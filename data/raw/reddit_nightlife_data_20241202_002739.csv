1gxeoy7,,,"I went on a Espresso Martini crawl a few months ago and here are my thoughts and some notes.

Let me start by saying I wanted to walk to all these spots so they're all in the Lakeview area.

First picture we have is Lark. We got two Espresso Martini's here. One from their Espresso Martini draft and one made by the bartender. I can't believe it but they were wildly similar. I thought the bartender made one was going to to blow away by the draft Espresso Martini but they were pretty comparable and both were honestly great. I do think it's cool that you can get an Espresso Martini on draft here lol 

Next up is one from Wood. They had by far the most ""fancy"" experience between the bartender and the atmosphere of the space. It's definitely not a stuffy uptight spot but compared to the other two we had this was the most buttoned up ambience. The Espresso Martini was great but honestly didn't standout much from the others.

Let me start by saying I wanted to walk to all these spots so they're all in the Lakeview area.

First picture we have is Lark. We got two Espresso Martini's here. One from their Espresso Martini draft and one made by the bartender. I can't believe it but they were wildly similar. I thought the bartender made one was going to to blow away by the draft Espresso Martini but they were pretty comparable and both were honestly great. I do think it's cool that you can get an Espresso Martini on draft here lol 

Next up is one from Wood. They had by far the most ""fancy"" experience between the bartender and the atmosphere of the space. It's definitely not a stuffy uptight spot but compared to the other two we had this was the most buttoned up ambience. The Espresso Martini was great but honestly didn't standout much from the others.

Only downside is it does get very crowded from time to time, and during the rush over Jan-Feb it got so bad I almost wouldn’t go at certain times because there would be a wait for squat racks, bench, or space on the turf to workout. There is a ton of cardio equipment so you’ll almost never have to wait to use any of that. Their app has a feature to check the current people in the gym which helps.

I’m a big sauna user and the thing that did annoy me was the saunas there (2 in the men’s locker room) are a total gossip hour and get extremely crowded. It’s common you’ll have to wait standing up to get a seat, and there are tons of loud convos as there is a pretty large “sauna crew” that uses the sauna to catch up and discuss stuff. Not terrible if you’re into that but if you’re trying to meditate you won’t be able to. They also just redid one of them, and I believe are in process or about to be in process of renovating the other.

Food is avg quality, price around 20-30 or so per dish, but a good area.

The last time this happened was 1946-1961. But we had two pretty good excuses back then, because:

* The Chicago Bulls did not exist yet, and

* Baseball and football only had one-round playoffs in the first place.

No such excuses now that every league has its largest playoff structure ever.

* Just two winning seasons, both by the Cubs, both at 83-79, and neither including a playoff appearance.

* Two seasons in which one of our franchises lost more games in a single season than it's lost in any other season in its century-plus-long history: the Bears losing 14 games and the White Sox of course losing 121.

* At least three new franchise-record losing streaks: the Bears' 10-game streak, the White Sox's 14-game streak in May-June, and the White Sox's 21-game streak in July-August.

* The worst single-season Blackhawks record since the 1950s.

* Nikola Vucevic

* Two ostensibly proud franchises approach taxpayers, hat in hand, asking for public money to fund stadiums where they will continue to field a losing product

* The White Sox losing more games than any other major league baseball franchise has lost in the 20th or 21st century, and the most since the days when the actual Cy Young was still in the first half of his career literally 125 years ago.

Why shouldn't we pay taxes when everyone else has to?  Because we're the Chicago Bears, that's why!""  Then they announce they are looking at random other sites in the middle of nowhere that have no chance, and also that the lakefront is back on the table.

4. The Bears apparently change their mind again and say that staying at the Soldier Field site is their preferred option instead of Arlington Heights.

5. They put out an announcement with their vision for the new lakefront stadium...with renderings and a video, of the most absolutely tacky, gaudy, godawful looking stadium you could possibly imagine that totally ruins the lakefront.  Then say ""we are making a record personal investment in this project...but we also need $2+ BILLION in taxpayer money to make it happen.""

1gxr5mr,Chicago,Which Chicago neighborhood for us?,"Hello, all.  Given the recent election results, we are looking to leave the very red state of Ohio and move from Columbus to the city of Chicago.  We are a gay male couple, ages 51 and 66.  We are looking at this as our last move and where we will settle, retire, and live out the last years of our lives.  We are also looking at it as an adventure.  We are both very analytical and tend to overthink, which is probably why we are more than a little overwhelmed doing research.  

We have been researching real estate and YouTube videos of various neighborhoods and reading threads to try and suss out where we should focus our search.  We currently live in a peaceful, quiet suburb of Columbus about 20 minutes from the city.  That said, we are both urban guys.  We love the vibrancy and diversity of living in or close to a city.  

So...what are we looking for?  We don't want to be so far removed from downtown that it's a hassle to get there to see a show or go out to eat.  We love culture, particularly theatre, museums, comedy clubs, coffee shops, small businesses, the symphony.  I am a runner, and we both go to the gym.  Ideally, we would want to be less than 15-20 minutes walk to public transit and have relatively easy access to grocery stores, coffee shops, and dining options, especially as we get up there in years.  We are looking to purchase a condo, and our budget will be in the $300K - $375K range.  

We have been to Chicago a handful of times and are not opposed to taking a reconnaissance trip to explore areas on foot.  Which neighborhoods should we be zeroing in on that will suit us best?

We are looking at this as our last move and where we will settle, retire, and live out the last years of our lives.  We are also looking at it as an adventure.  We are both very analytical and tend to overthink, which is probably why we are more than a little overwhelmed doing research.  

We have been researching real estate and YouTube videos of various neighborhoods and reading threads to try and suss out where we should focus our search.  We currently live in a peaceful, quiet suburb of Columbus about 20 minutes from the city.  That said, we are both urban guys.  We love the vibrancy and diversity of living in or close to a city.  

So...what are we looking for?  We don't want to be so far removed from downtown that it's a hassle to get there to see a show or go out to eat.  We love culture, particularly theatre, museums, comedy clubs, coffee shops, small businesses, the symphony.  I am a runner, and we both go to the gym.  Ideally, we would want to be less than 15-20 minutes walk to public transit and have relatively easy access to grocery stores, coffee shops, and dining options, especially as we get up there in years.  We are looking to purchase a condo, and our budget will be in the $300K - $375K range.  

We have been to Chicago a handful of times and are not opposed to taking a reconnaissance trip to explore areas on foot.  Which neighborhoods should we be zeroing in on that will suit us best?

1h3cyd9,Chicago,The telling thing about the Bears no one is talking about,"The Bears have been pulling the whole ""when the lease comes to an end we need a new stadium"" ordeal that many teams team seems to pull nowadays.  But IMO this is the most indicative stereotypical ""Bears way"" of handling something.

1.  The Bears write a letter complaining about the city and the mayor, and say because of the city they are basically forced to pursue other options.

2. In reality they wanted to join the club of owners who own the stadium and the real estate development around it, so they buy all that land in Arlington Heights and take down the race track.  Then say they are developing Arlington Heights and are no longer dealing with the city of Chicago as its not an option anymore.

3. The city of Arlington Heights doesn't give them exemption from property tax, so they throw a hissy fit.  ""Taxes??  We are the Chicago Bears, we shouldn't pay taxes.

1go4ol6,Chicago,Great time at Auditorium Theatre last night - Chicago Philharmonic performing Bram Stoker’s Dracula ,"Last night the Chicago Philharmonic performed Wojciech Kilar’s score to the movie Bram Stoker’s Dracula. They screened the movie as well. 

Before the performance, pianist Alex Dębicz played a melody of Kilar movie scores. Then, he participated on a panel with horror and music scholars (two of whom flew in from Warsaw for this event). They discussed Kilar, the work for Dracula specifically, and his relationship with movie scores. 

Then, Svengoolie stopped by! He talked about the movie a bit and emcee’d a costume contest. (Before the show, there was a VIP experience where you could meet him, but that cost extra.) I felt a rush of joy when the Svengoolie opening music played him on stage. 

The performance itself was fantastic. In particular, the soprano Victoria Schemenauer was immaculate. Absolutely divine singing that was perfectly suited to the eerie and romantic solos. The music is so BIG, and seeing it performed live really lets you see how Kilar makes use of different parts of the orchestra. I’ve seen the movie quite a few times and listened to the score, but I didn’t realize how much of the music is in the style of a march. Makes sense, given Dracula’s military background (and the thematic idea that stakes of the characters’ battles are life and death, good vs evil).  

I love these music-and-movie orchestral events- I’ve been to a few at the CSO, and this is my first time at the Auditorium.  I can’t wait to go back!

1go4ol6,Chicago,Great time at Auditorium Theatre last night - Chicago Philharmonic performing Bram Stoker’s Dracula ,"Last night the Chicago Philharmonic performed Wojciech Kilar’s score to the movie Bram Stoker’s Dracula. They screened the movie as well. 

Before the performance, pianist Alex Dębicz played a melody of Kilar movie scores. Then, he participated on a panel with horror and music scholars (two of whom flew in from Warsaw for this event). They discussed Kilar, the work for Dracula specifically, and his relationship with movie scores. 

Then, Svengoolie stopped by! He talked about the movie a bit and emcee’d a costume contest. (Before the show, there was a VIP experience where you could meet him, but that cost extra.) I felt a rush of joy when the Svengoolie opening music played him on stage. 

The performance itself was fantastic. In particular, the soprano Victoria Schemenauer was immaculate. Absolutely divine singing that was perfectly suited to the eerie and romantic solos. The music is so BIG, and seeing it performed live really lets you see how Kilar makes use of different parts of the orchestra. I’ve seen the movie quite a few times and listened to the score, but I didn’t realize how much of the music is in the style of a march. Makes sense, given Dracula’s military background (and the thematic idea that stakes of the characters’ battles are life and death, good vs evil).  

I love these music-and-movie orchestral events- I’ve been to a few at the CSO, and this is my first time at the Auditorium.  I can’t wait to go back!

It's a girl!! Jiji is now five months old, has all her shots, and is a healthy ball of energy. She is getting along great with her new siblings and is a certified yapper as all black cats should be. There was no microchip and we will be spaying her at the six month mark as recommended by our vet.

It was a long road to get her comfortable. She spent three weeks in our bathroom with minimal progress with trusting humans. It was a great time for her to play with the other cats under the door and begin the introduction process. Eventually we moved her to the bedroom where it took another couple weeks for her to make serious gains in trusting us. Jiji is still quite skittish and has only recently showed interest in playing with us over her siblings or by herself. She does LOVE toys though and hordes them in secret locations. Sometimes outright snatching them from our hands and running away to stow them. The whole apartment has been open to her for a few weeks now and snuggles in bed or on the couch are becoming more and more common.

u/shredfromthecrypt I’m so glad I have the chance to address this somewhat publicly lol. The 80’s thing is something press took and ran with. The bar is *aesthetically influenced* with 80’s inspiration in some ways, and is 100% one of my best friends/owners style selection. We are not trying to be *Totally Tubular* like one headline read, lol.

Our ENTIRE menu is available gluten free, as has been mentioned before one of our owners has a gluten intolerance. The food rips, and as u/Ok-Buffalo-756 mentioned, our chef/one of the owners, Mark, WAS Funkenhausen, and I was the beverage director there. Might I recommend the Common Burger ($9 single/$15 double, garlic fries with both), our Thrice Cooked Wings (brined, baked, smoked & then fried) tossed in our house-fermented Fresno pepper “buffalo” sauce & either house made ranch/blue cheese, or the mozzarella sticks served with a bangin’ spicy arrabbiata sauce & green goddess.  

And speaking of our food, and our menu as whole, we’re launching a whole new menu in the next week or so! Adding a charcuterie section of all house cured meats, a killer steak tartare, flipping our cocktail menu and adding around 15 more drinks (a few of us are ex-Moneygun, we love a big menu).

u/Ajannkstar you ended up visiting during our monthly “Indecent” Burlesque night, which is the second Thursday of each month! It’s always a blast, but I definitely understand it being a little much if you didn’t know it was happening! 

We’re really proud of our upcoming programming, a few events/happenings we have:

— Industry Mondays! Industry friends DJ, $3 Hamm’s, $5 shots, always a blast  

— Happy Hour everyday from 4-6pm, come check it out because it absolutely kills  

— Tita Tootsie’s pop-up 11/27  

— Our 2nd “Indecent Market”, local makers pop-up and offer their services/goods. Our first one included local artists, a nail tech, tarot reading, and a tattoo artist!  

We have plenty of other things coming up during the holiday season including a clothing swap/drive, a holiday bar crawl with some of the bars mentioned here (looking at you bestie, Cara Cara!), some sneak peek dinners lined up to preview what we’re gonna be offering at our sleeping sister bar Fever Dream, that’s hiding behind the curtain when you walk in. Peep our instagram @commondecency_chicago to keep up! 

We’re a group of friends that opened this spot independently and with each other. Our opening got pushed back for months and months (as they always do in this business, the city takes forever to mail permits), but a monumental, unexpected tragedy was and continues to be the hardest thing for us to even attempt to navigate. Our best friend, co-owner, chef, the heart & soul of our operation passed away unexpectedly just a week before we were gonna open our doors.

Issues this year:
 
- Vendors sucked, there were maybe three good vendors out of the 8-9. It was so obvious who the good vendors were because they had the longest lines in the venue. It is a huge downgrade from vendors last year, with over 12 vendors, and majority of them being good, this year was a massive disappointment. 

- There was no line control, and honest to god, it felt like the space was too small. Too many people waiting in these long lines because vendors quickly ran out of pizza. You can feel everyone’s annoyance. Especially since we all paid $70 to be there. 

- The drink selection sucks. They had the worst seltzers ever and even worse wine and beer selection. Everyone at the bar complained so much people just paid the $13 for a cocktail. 

- Pizzas took forever to come out. And I understand they were sharing ovens and only had so many. But there are so many better ways to provide oven and resources for vendors, and for the 6th year of this happening. I can’t believe they haven’t figured it out. 

- Last but very petty point, it was way too dark in there. You will see by my photos. 

The only positive was the infused pizza. A slice with about 4 mg of THC was very nice!

1h26sqt,ChicagoFood,Perilla might have changed my life,"## Premise
Last week I’ve visited this amazing city for a business trip and added a couple of days before and after the convention. Thank you company I work for

As a proper foodie, and something which you all might do, I’ve seen scouting Reddit, IG, the internet, asking friends about the best places to eat in Chicago. In the end I’ve constructed a list of 68 places to eat and drink. In 8 days. Let’s go

## honorary mentions
**Dearborn**
What an amazing atmosphere this place has. Very classy, very cozy. Our waiter Cooper was down to earth, attentive and an all round great guy. I’ve worked for 10ish years in the service industry I recognize a great one. He certainly is.

The food: splendid. Everything had the perfect balance and tasted amazing. From the meze to the steaks. Best thing on the menu: fried chicken with honey glazed. Pure perfection 

**Bavette’s**
This place had such a good ambiance. Went downstairs to the private room and the whole vibe is such a treat. We had steaks with some sides and were completely stuffed

Classic Chicago Ribeye and my colleagues both had the dry aged bone in NY strip. Probably one of the best steaks I’ve had in my life. 

## Perilla
Let’s get down to business. Last dinner of the trip and we were on the hunt for a place to eat. During lunch we were on a mission to make it a memorable one. However, no reservations yet on a Saturday evening? Chances of getting something nice: slim to none.

While at Cindy’s having a couple of cocktails, Perilla so happened to have a table left at 9 PM. Already a win. Being the one that compiled the exhaustive list of restaurants, I was more than happy we got in.

Arriving a tad early, we were seated at the bar for a couple of old fashioned’s. Great ambiance, maybe a bit less than Dearborn or Bavette, but great nonetheless. Our server was splendid, she did such a great job. Pure professionalism. 

**The food**
For starters: Snow Crab, oysters and giant Shrimps with Foie Gras on blueberry toast, and Korean Steak Tartare with fried seaweed. These were all soooo good. Steak tartare with fried seaweed? Amazing find. 

As the mains: Korean fried chicken, the steakhouse set for two which was accompanied by 3 different kinds of kimchi, the grilled mushrooms and kimchi fried rice.

Ok, I’m from Europe. We don’t really deal in superlatives all that much. However, listen to me: KIMCHI FRIED RICE. You need to understand that this might have been the best dish I’ve eaten. As in: final meal on my resting bed territory. First time since a very long time I’ve been this much surprised by a meal. Just simply out of this world. 

Lastly: the Korean fried chicken. How on earth did they get it like that? Crunchy exterior and a soft and delicate inside. Again, just wow. These two dishes are easily in the top 10 of dishes I’ve had in my life.

I’ve read so much about this amazing place so please accept my humble review. Great city, amazing vibe and even better food. Will be back! ",455,0.96,22.0,2024-11-28 15:58:44,bar,,,,"Perilla might have changed my life ## Premise

1giej1x,ChicagoFood,Dinner at Bistro Monadnock,"Was catching Some Like It Hot and decided to have dinner before. The Loop is usually pretty lackluster in terms of good food.

I know u/TriedForMitchcraft shouted these guys out for great fries, and so the stars aligned.

Overall, I was very pleased with dinner. It was just nice, solid bistro fare. 

We got a Gibson and a Gimlet to start. Being owned by the same group as Victor Bar / Love Street, I’d expect the cocktails to be on point and they were excellent. The Gibson was clean and stirred perfectly. The Gimlet was refreshing and light.

We started with their Bread and Butter and some Escargot. Baguette was fresh and the housemade butter was excellent. 

Escargot with puff pastry was a nice touch. I enjoyed the bit of red pepper thrown in with the  escargot butter. The puff pastry was an excellent touch to sop up extra butter. I wanted the escargot to be a touch saltier? Something was a little subdued, and while I enjoy just eating butter, something about it just wasn’t hitting the umami button that I wanted from escargot.

My wife got the gnocchi Parisienne  with chestnut mushroom, a sunchoke cream sauce, moroccan olives, marinated tomato, preserved lemon, aleppo pepper. Gnocchi was cooked perfectly, and the mix of mushroom, pepper, and tomato was divine. Totally stole the show.

Steak frite was a classic base hit. As Mitch pointed out before, their fries are money. I had an instant ratatouille moment, taking me back to the first time I had the original McDonald’s fries, fried in beef tallow. Flatiron steak was exceptionally cooked to medium rare, and the char on it was perfectly. I normally am disappointed by restaurant steak, as I can usually make better steak at home, but this was on point.

After dinner, we settled for cocktails, and I had their house made Amer Picon, which was an excellent digestif. Like the essence of a Negroni.

$200 subtotal on the dot. Expensive yes, but, again, a nice addition to the Loop.

1ghn9rw,ChicagoFood,Tasting menu at Oriole (November 2024).,"I went for the tasting menu at Oriole and had a wonderful meal. **9.25/10 overall.**

**Food - 9.** The food was absolutely delicious for the most part. There were many bites that were real standouts (all 4 starters, the tomato accompanying the lobster, capellini, wagyu, and rosemary), but this made me more critical of the courses which didn't quite live up to those bold flavors. The plates were colorful and attractive without being challenging to consume. I also sprung for the seasonal white truffle supplement ($125). I thought it was a great addition to the capellini course but felt betrayed by the dessert add-on which just tasted overwhelmingly (and tragically) like banana to me. The textures were amazing though, so as long as you don't hate banana like I do, you'll probably love it.

**Drinks - 9.** I opted for the non-alcoholic beverage pairing and it was fantastic. Nearly all the drinks were pleasing in appearance, scent, and texture on their own. They all had creative, complex flavor profiles which paired perfectly with the food and never felt boring. The drinks were a little sweet for my preference (I generally prefer citrusy, dry, or crisp beverages) but not unpalatably so. I also ordered tea along with the dessert courses based on my server's recommendation, and that was also nice.

**Service - 10.** The hospitality was exceptional. All of the staff were warm and welcoming and happy to engage by answering questions, making recommendations, and sharing their favorite parts of the meal. Service was prompt and professional yet still felt relaxed.

**Ambiance - 8.5.** This was an interesting experience. You start off in an antique, industrial-looking elevator which doubles as a foyer. You're then gradually escorted through a few distinct areas of the restaurant while being served some small bites along the way to your final destination. It felt a little contrived, but I still enjoyed seeing the different spaces, and these were some of the best courses, so no complaints there. The actual dining room had dark, moody lighting and music which was almost too loud at times. This was my least favorite spot in terms of decor, but it was still clean and comfortable, and I liked being able to peek into the open kitchen from my table.

**Note:** The bill includes a 20% service charge which covers gratuity. This is automatically added when booking your reservation in advance online, but not to anything purchased directly at the restaurant.

**Would I go again?** Yes.

1h2agaq,ChicagoFood,A Very Merry Hawksmoor Thanksgiving!,"Decided to do a solo Thanksgiving at the bar at Hawksmoor today! 

Arrived around 4 without a reservation and was able to get a spot at the bar (my preference). I’ve been once before, with a group, for Sunday roast. 

I got the Prime Rib Roast thanksgiving special ($68) — all the usual Sunday roast trimmings but with a nice slice of prime rib.  The carrots, roasted garlic & cabbage were outstanding.  I honestly have no notes.  The Yorkshire pudding was good but maybe not the most stellar Yorkshire I’ve ever had.  The prime rib was delicious and the whole thing was just the right proportions.  

I also got a few drinks: the Finder’s Keeper cocktail, a glass of Pinot Blanco and a Hawksmoor Irish Coffee after dessert.  All really well made — definitely would recommend the Irish coffee, it was perfect balance of sweet and espresso. 

For dessert I got the coconut passion fruit pavlova, which was an ideal balance to my starchy meal.  I’m not really into chocolate or toffee pudding and this was the only lighter/fruity dessert.  I had to stop myself from licking the plate. 

Service was fantastic — the bartenders were so helpful and major shout out to Katie for such excellent service.  

Definitely looking forward to coming back again and trying other menu items.  Great atmosphere — not too loud and comfortable seating.  

I first visited Hawksmoor in Seven Dials a few years ago and I’m so glad it’s come here to Chicago.

1gnt93j,ChicagoFood,Tasting menu at Schwa (November 2024).,"I went for the tasting menu at Schwa and had a fun time. **7.5/10 overall.**

**Food - 7.5.** As with many experimental restaurants, this was hit-or-miss. But the food was *never* boring. There were several courses that I enjoyed immensely (raviolo, à la mode, quail, cheese, float) but also a couple that were complete misses for me (ramen, fluff, tea). Opinion was divided across our table, though, so your perception of the food will depend on your palate and what appeals to you personally. Although I didn't love everything I ate, I still really appreciated the chefs' creativity and fearlessness when it came to bold flavors, interesting textures, and unusual combinations. The portions were on the smaller side, so if you have a big appetite, you might walk away hungry. I left decently full, but I would've liked larger plates to be able to explore the dishes better - there were so many interesting components, but many were in such small quantities that I couldn't mix and match and assemble multiple bites with them. Finally, many of the dishes are eaten with your hands rather than utensils, so if that bothers you, plan accordingly.

**Drinks - N/A.** The restaurant is BYOB. We went overboard with drinks so our table ended up overcrowded with bottles, but that's our fault. They offered us a complimentary round of shots (whiskey or tea) at the end of the meal, which was a pleasant surprise.

**Service - 7.5.** You're on your own for the most part as the servers are also the chefs busy preparing your meal. As such, the pacing was a little inconsistent, sometimes rather fast and occasionally a bit slow, but not too noticeable if you're with good company. The introductions to each course were impressively descriptive, and the chefs were happy to answer questions and offer suggestions on the best way to approach each dish. (Lastly, although I'm not factoring it into my rating since these interactions took place outside of our dining experience, I think this still deserves acknowledgement and appreciation: the restaurant was very helpful and quick to respond when I reached out about scheduling, dietary restrictions, and recommendations for beverage pairings.)

**Ambiance - 6.** This is a no-frills, unpretentious dining experience. It's dark and can get quite loud between the upbeat music and conversation of nearby guests. I wouldn't recommend visiting as a solo diner or a party that prefers formality, but it was a great atmosphere for a casual social outing. I'd say the vibe leans much more towards a bustling bar than pompous fine dining.

I went for the tasting menu at Schwa and had a fun time. **7.5/10 overall.**

**Food - 7.5.** As with many experimental restaurants, this was hit-or-miss. But the food was *never* boring. There were several courses that I enjoyed immensely (raviolo, à la mode, quail, cheese, float) but also a couple that were complete misses for me (ramen, fluff, tea). Opinion was divided across our table, though, so your perception of the food will depend on your palate and what appeals to you personally. Although I didn't love everything I ate, I still really appreciated the chefs' creativity and fearlessness when it came to bold flavors, interesting textures, and unusual combinations. The portions were on the smaller side, so if you have a big appetite, you might walk away hungry. I left decently full, but I would've liked larger plates to be able to explore the dishes better - there were so many interesting components, but many were in such small quantities that I couldn't mix and match and assemble multiple bites with them. Finally, many of the dishes are eaten with your hands rather than utensils, so if that bothers you, plan accordingly.

**Drinks - N/A.** The restaurant is BYOB. We went overboard with drinks so our table ended up overcrowded with bottles, but that's our fault. They offered us a complimentary round of shots (whiskey or tea) at the end of the meal, which was a pleasant surprise.

**Service - 7.5.** You're on your own for the most part as the servers are also the chefs busy preparing your meal. As such, the pacing was a little inconsistent, sometimes rather fast and occasionally a bit slow, but not too noticeable if you're with good company. The introductions to each course were impressively descriptive, and the chefs were happy to answer questions and offer suggestions on the best way to approach each dish. (Lastly, although I'm not factoring it into my rating since these interactions took place outside of our dining experience, I think this still deserves acknowledgement and appreciation: the restaurant was very helpful and quick to respond when I reached out about scheduling, dietary restrictions, and recommendations for beverage pairings.)

**Ambiance - 6.** This is a no-frills, unpretentious dining experience. It's dark and can get quite loud between the upbeat music and conversation of nearby guests. I wouldn't recommend visiting as a solo diner or a party that prefers formality, but it was a great atmosphere for a casual social outing. I'd say the vibe leans much more towards a bustling bar than pompous fine dining.

**Note:** The bill includes a 20% service charge (covering gratuity) which is disclosed upfront when making the reservation. You don't receive any sort of bill at the restaurant.

**Would I go again?** Yes, I want to support restaurants that aren't afraid to innovate. I'd come back with friends if they introduced enough new dishes.

We are doing the 7-course drinks and bites menu at Aviary on 1/3 - will that fill us up or should we plan on more food before/after?

We can also adjust our trip and go Jan 2-6 if there is just nothing interesting open on Jan 1...any thoughts/guidance would be appreciated. I haven't lived there in ages and don't have a good pulse on the city anymore.

It was chaos in there -- the guy at the register seemed confused about how the register/discounts worked, the guy behind the bar didn't know how to work the taps and was unable to pour a beer, the one waitress on staff would just burst out of the kitchen and shout out the order (it seemed like no one was communicating to her what tables ordered what?) and they were out of most things on the menu. The floor was a total disaster too, with pieces of pizza and receipts everywhere. We were served our food on paper plates, which is totally fine but was not the case before they re-opened. Not that this Dimo's location was ever that awesome, but it seemed particularly awful today. 

Did they close and fire all of the old employees and then quickly reopen with an untrained skeleton crew? Why? I can't see them lasting too long like this but would love the scoop if anyone knows whats going on. 

Edited to add: I totally understand that opening a new place is hard, I've worked in food service for years -- It's just surprising how bad the reopen was, considering that they were only closed for a couple of weeks.

I’ll be there early Thursday to late Sunday, near the Mag Mile (Knickerbocker hotel).

I’m basically looking for a mix of mainstream shopping in Mag Mile and Gold Coast areas, and spending time out in the neighborhoods.

A couple of specific things I want are a specialty liquor store for things I can’t get in Canada (leaning Binny’s) and an Italian or other type of upscale market to buy obscure tinned seafood. Also a central market type thing too (I think there’s a Christmas market going on I may look at).

Here’s the food research so far. I basically need some help grouping by geography and in a way that makes sense to do on the same day. I realize this may feel a bit one dimensional but we have a great multi cultural food scene where I am from so it’s not a high travel priority for me.

One key dinner I want is somewhere with a classic old school Chicago feel. I’ve looked at La Scarola but heard the service concerns. Others that have come up are Mart Anthony, ignotz, All vita, Elina’s, Formento’s, rose Mary? I am probably leaning to Mart Anthony.

1h18q1w,ChicagoFood,Mid December trip feedback please,"Hi all, will be visiting in mid-December from Toronto. I hope this post is sufficiently high effort - normally I would go a bit further but have been absolutely underwater lately, so any patience you can extend me would be much appreciated. 

I’ll be there early Thursday to late Sunday, near the Mag Mile (Knickerbocker hotel).

I’m basically looking for a mix of mainstream shopping in Mag Mile and Gold Coast areas, and spending time out in the neighborhoods.

A couple of specific things I want are a specialty liquor store for things I can’t get in Canada (leaning Binny’s) and an Italian or other type of upscale market to buy obscure tinned seafood. Also a central market type thing too (I think there’s a Christmas market going on I may look at).

Here’s the food research so far. I basically need some help grouping by geography and in a way that makes sense to do on the same day. I realize this may feel a bit one dimensional but we have a great multi cultural food scene where I am from so it’s not a high travel priority for me.

One key dinner I want is somewhere with a classic old school Chicago feel. I’ve looked at La Scarola but heard the service concerns. Others that have come up are Mart Anthony, ignotz, All vita, Elina’s, Formento’s, rose Mary? I am probably leaning to Mart Anthony.

But some things which are more likely to occur when alone are being stuffed into a corner (even when the restaurant is empty) or poor service (being ignored, rushed, or made to feel like a hassle). This is especially irritating if I’ve purposefully come at an off time to avoid monopolizing a table at peak hours.

Some restaurants also have party size requirements for their tables, menus, or certain dishes, so it’s annoying to try and make a solo reservation.",['Chicago lately'],710,True

So here are few recent winners (imho) and I will add to this list as I go along.

1. Afghan Bamyan (https://g.co/kgs/QCwUJLv). Great food. Great kebab. The 12 dollar special is really good value
2. Gold coast cafe (https://maps.app.goo.gl/yWXvAKoxYZP2TspM7). Probably doing a dis-service to myself but where else do you get 99 cents coffee / espresso that is good. and iirc $7 fresh warm bagel sandwich
3. Goose Island Shrimp house (https://g.co/kgs/TRvQVT5). Cant go wrong with this classic. Still holding strong. Under 10$ fried seafood. It is a takeaway so take it away to nearby Off Color Brewing (https://g.co/kgs/TRvQVT5) that is a great bring your own food place. Maybe in the summer
4. Should I or should I not add the 4$ chicken special at the Jewel Osco Deli. It is pushing the very limit on what qualifies as good food. But if you only have 4$ (plus tax) - and purchase it when it is fresher - you may not go wrong with grilled chicken protein. It will fill you without killing you or making you feel queasy afterwards. I have been a repeat buyer so I guess it is not all that bad though my partner does not share my opinion.
5. Pinipico Coffee (https://maps.app.goo.gl/HgCLozW9ftpYjXVL6) has a very acceptable coffee + empanada combo for 7$
6. Al-Diar for adeni tea (2 $) and Mogadishu for somalian tea (1$). Both at cross of Oak St and Orleans. The adeni tea is phenomenal (does have milk &and sugar, imho more flavorful than Indian sub-continent chai)

1h26sqt,ChicagoFood,Perilla might have changed my life,"## Premise
Last week I’ve visited this amazing city for a business trip and added a couple of days before and after the convention. Thank you company I work for

As a proper foodie, and something which you all might do, I’ve seen scouting Reddit, IG, the internet, asking friends about the best places to eat in Chicago. In the end I’ve constructed a list of 68 places to eat and drink. In 8 days. Let’s go

## honorary mentions
**Dearborn**
What an amazing atmosphere this place has. Very classy, very cozy. Our waiter Cooper was down to earth, attentive and an all round great guy. I’ve worked for 10ish years in the service industry I recognize a great one. He certainly is.

The food: splendid. Everything had the perfect balance and tasted amazing. From the meze to the steaks. Best thing on the menu: fried chicken with honey glazed. Pure perfection 

**Bavette’s**
This place had such a good ambiance. Went downstairs to the private room and the whole vibe is such a treat. We had steaks with some sides and were completely stuffed

Classic Chicago Ribeye and my colleagues both had the dry aged bone in NY strip. Probably one of the best steaks I’ve had in my life. 

## Perilla
Let’s get down to business. Last dinner of the trip and we were on the hunt for a place to eat. During lunch we were on a mission to make it a memorable one. However, no reservations yet on a Saturday evening? Chances of getting something nice: slim to none.

While at Cindy’s having a couple of cocktails, Perilla so happened to have a table left at 9 PM. Already a win. Being the one that compiled the exhaustive list of restaurants, I was more than happy we got in.

Arriving a tad early, we were seated at the bar for a couple of old fashioned’s. Great ambiance, maybe a bit less than Dearborn or Bavette, but great nonetheless. Our server was splendid, she did such a great job. Pure professionalism. 

**The food**
For starters: Snow Crab, oysters and giant Shrimps with Foie Gras on blueberry toast, and Korean Steak Tartare with fried seaweed. These were all soooo good. Steak tartare with fried seaweed? Amazing find. 

As the mains: Korean fried chicken, the steakhouse set for two which was accompanied by 3 different kinds of kimchi, the grilled mushrooms and kimchi fried rice.

Ok, I’m from Europe. We don’t really deal in superlatives all that much. However, listen to me: KIMCHI FRIED RICE. You need to understand that this might have been the best dish I’ve eaten. As in: final meal on my resting bed territory. First time since a very long time I’ve been this much surprised by a meal. Just simply out of this world. 

Lastly: the Korean fried chicken. How on earth did they get it like that? Crunchy exterior and a soft and delicate inside. Again, just wow. These two dishes are easily in the top 10 of dishes I’ve had in my life.

I’ve read so much about this amazing place so please accept my humble review. Great city, amazing vibe and even better food. Will be back! ",453,0.96,22.0,2024-11-28 15:58:44,restaurant,,,,"Perilla might have changed my life ## Premise

1gryzj4,ChicagoFood,Oaxaca: The Feast of the 7 Moles tasting menu at Topolobampo (November 2024).,"I went to the current tasting menu at Topolobampo with high expectations and left a little disappointed. **6.5/10 overall.**

Before I get into my experience, I want to emphasize that all restaurants have off nights. I hope this just happened to be one of them and that other people have a more enjoyable time than I did. If you went for this menu and had a great time, I’d love to hear about it.

**Food - 7.** I love bold, complex flavors, so I was really excited for a menu dedicated entirely to moles. The moles themselves were pretty delicious, yet somehow most of the dishes ended up tasting just okay. In my opinion, it was sometimes a lack of balance, or an odd texture, or too many competing elements on the plate which ended up detracting from the overall dish. In sharp contrast, the mole negro with 3 different cuts of wagyu was spectacular (minus the accompaniments) - so the potential to wow is absolutely there. Dinner also came with several surprise additions, which were some of the best bites of the night.

**Drinks - 4.** This one is kind of funny and mostly my fault. I'm not much of a drinker but I decided to try something new and unusual (for me) and opted for the agave pairing because it sounded intriguing. I then promptly discovered that I don't enjoy agave spirits in large quantities, as they disrupt my palate and also don’t agree with my stomach… So needless to say, I didn’t enjoy the pairing at all. I found it hard to appreciate the nuances in the drinks beyond the overwhelming burning sensation, and what little I could discern didn’t seem to complement or enhance the food at all. On the other hand, I quite enjoyed the non-alcoholic paloma highball I purchased in the lounge to accompany the appetizers. That bright and refreshing drink singlehandedly salvaged this rating from a 0. I wish I would’ve stuck to cocktails throughout the evening instead.

**Service - 6.** Most of the staff were friendly and enthusiastic, so I feel bad about this score, but there were some significant issues with service overall. The pacing was incredibly slow, not only at my table, but throughout the entire dining room. It was to the point where guests appeared visibly uncomfortable. There were only 6 courses listed on the menu, but with the addition of some surprise appetizers and small bites, the experience lasted around 2.5 hours, most of which was spent waiting. The timing of courses was also strange, with collisions between the staff trying to present pairings and dishes simultaneously and inconsistencies in how things were served. The staff seemed to struggle to recall details of the courses at times, which is surprising given that this menu isn't new. It was also very hard to hear them speak over the loud music. Service wavered between overbearing (constantly asking if everything was okay) and nonexistent (needing to flag someone down to ask for more water). For me, the most disappointing part of the meal was when they forgot to serve a supplement I’d ordered in advance; they apologized and refunded me, but the experience was very awkward. My final bill was also inaccurate (in my favor), so I recommend double-checking before you pay.

**Ambiance - 6.5.** I liked the space itself, though the tables felt weirdly claustrophobic in their spacing. The decor was warm, the art was interesting, and the seats were comfortable. What I didn’t like was how loud the music was - it was extremely challenging for me to hear the servers describe the courses, and I missed a lot of details. It was also somewhat cold despite being fairly close to the kitchen. But worst of all was the palpable awkwardness lingering throughout the dining room as we all patiently waited and waited for our next course.

**Note:** The bill includes a 20% service charge (that covers gratuity) when booking online. This charge is not automatically applied to anything extra you order at the restaurant.

**Would I go again?** I don’t think so… Not unless there was a menu I absolutely couldn’t resist.

And now for photos. Please excuse the quality (even worse than usual); the lighting left much to be desired.

I went to the current tasting menu at Topolobampo with high expectations and left a little disappointed. **6.5/10 overall.**

Before I get into my experience, I want to emphasize that all restaurants have off nights. I hope this just happened to be one of them and that other people have a more enjoyable time than I did. If you went for this menu and had a great time, I’d love to hear about it.

**Food - 7.** I love bold, complex flavors, so I was really excited for a menu dedicated entirely to moles. The moles themselves were pretty delicious, yet somehow most of the dishes ended up tasting just okay. In my opinion, it was sometimes a lack of balance, or an odd texture, or too many competing elements on the plate which ended up detracting from the overall dish. In sharp contrast, the mole negro with 3 different cuts of wagyu was spectacular (minus the accompaniments) - so the potential to wow is absolutely there. Dinner also came with several surprise additions, which were some of the best bites of the night.

**Drinks - 4.** This one is kind of funny and mostly my fault. I'm not much of a drinker but I decided to try something new and unusual (for me) and opted for the agave pairing because it sounded intriguing. I then promptly discovered that I don't enjoy agave spirits in large quantities, as they disrupt my palate and also don’t agree with my stomach… So needless to say, I didn’t enjoy the pairing at all. I found it hard to appreciate the nuances in the drinks beyond the overwhelming burning sensation, and what little I could discern didn’t seem to complement or enhance the food at all. On the other hand, I quite enjoyed the non-alcoholic paloma highball I purchased in the lounge to accompany the appetizers. That bright and refreshing drink singlehandedly salvaged this rating from a 0. I wish I would’ve stuck to cocktails throughout the evening instead.

**Service - 6.** Most of the staff were friendly and enthusiastic, so I feel bad about this score, but there were some significant issues with service overall.

1gj1q21,ChicagoFood,My two cents on Dear Margaret,"First timer at Dear Margaret and I thought it offered something refreshingly sincere in Chicago's dining scene. It was the first time in a long time where I felt the restaurant managed to feel both special and comfortable, where genuine hospitality wasn't just a buzzword but a clear priority. It was the kind of place where you can tell the staff genuinely cared about what they were serving – and that made all the difference. No flashy gimmicks, but a place with thoughtful cooking and warm hospitality that makes me want to be a regular.

The fries were a testament to doing simple things exceptionally well – fried in beef tallow, served with a truffle aioli that avoided the usual heavy-handed application of truffle. The Pommes Dauphine, those delicate French potato puffs, arrived as a perfect starter: crisp exterior giving way to a decadent, creamy bite that set the tone for the meal to come.

What truly stood out for me was their treatment of vegetables. The roasted squash, with lemon charmoula and fantastic olive oil, demonstrated the kitchen's skill and creativity at balance and seasonality. While the much-talked-about smelt dish didn't quite reach the height of its reputation for me, it was a minor quibble in what was otherwise one of the year's most satisfying meals.

1gw8x42,ChicagoFood,Tasting menu at Valhalla (November 2024).,"I went for the tasting menu at Valhalla and yes, it really *was* that good. **9.5/10 overall.**

**Food - 9.25.** Personally, I loved it, but I don't think this menu will be a hit for everyone. It's a lot to eat, leans towards seafood (7/13 savory bites), has a distinct Asian flair, and includes some very intense flavor profiles. My favorite courses were the leng saeb-inspired beef breast and mixed seafood ceviche from the ""surf"" trio, which both had super bright, acidic, tangy components that I found delicious and refreshing. I enjoyed the rest of the menu as well and thought the only miss was the local vegetable gazpacho, which wasn't terrible, but just nowhere near the level of everything else. I also was impressed with the variety and execution of the dessert courses, and look forward to trying the rest of the tiny chocolates I had to take home.

**Drinks - 9.5.** This was a very pleasant surprise! I opted for the ""anything but wine"" beverage pairing and the bartender knocked it out of the park. Again, I think this was a happy coincidence of the flavors and alcohols happening to really suit my tastes. I love drinks that are fruity, citrusy, sharp, sour, or effervescent, and many of the cocktails and ciders were precisely that. Perhaps too much so for a normal person. My favorite cocktail included calamansi, caraway seeds, and dill salt, which sounds incredibly weird and *was* weird but also amazing and the best, most unique drink I've had this year. 

**Service - 10.** The seating is all at the chef's counter. Initially, it was very quiet and a little awkward as I was the only guest and was seated facing a mostly-empty kitchen while the chefs focused on their work along the other section of the counter. But my main server was welcoming and personable, as were the bartender and chefs once we actually began interacting. Everyone was extremely knowledgeable and happy to answer questions about the dishes and share interesting stories or recommendations. The service and presentation was highly polished and the staff clearly strive for perfection and pay close attention to detail.

**Ambiance - 8.5.** I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this. The decor was certainly interesting, and the lighting was moody and dramatic. I felt a little sorry for the chefs who seemed to be cooking in the dark. The background music was upbeat and electronic, but not too loud or distracting. It was fairly cold in the restaurant, but everything was immaculate and fortunately more comfortable than it looked. I'm not sure how they decide where to seat people for a slower service, but I would've preferred to face the chefs doing most of the preparations, as watching them work is my favorite part of a chef's counter experience.

1h029nz,ChicagoFood,Review – Give Feld a Star (Or Two!),"TLDR: I went to Feld for the first time on Saturday and had a phenomenal meal. Service, setting, concept, and flavors all knocked it out of the park. I have followed the criticism on Reddit and elsewhere—it may or may not have been warranted in the early days of the restaurant, but growing pains or no, this is a serious contender with the other tasting menus in Chicago and now one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. 

 

**Most Importantly: The Food** 

I read a lot of the ***positive*** reviews of Feld, and they all seemed to say the same things (it is so thoughtful, interesting, great concept, sourcing/ingredients, service, etc.), and also *omit* the same things: that the food actually tastes good. With so many of the good reviews dancing around the question, and as someone who cares way more about flavor than any other elements of the fine dining experience, I went in with low expectations. I honestly went to witness a train wreck, but instead got a magic show--everything tasted ***amazing***. It may be that it matched my palate well (I generally enjoy hot, salty, intense, etc.), but even the types of dishes I am not usually keen on were great. I loved the length of the menu and experience, and hope they stick with this course-overload approach because it is hard to find now. Going through the pictures in order: 

 

1. The duck broth came right when we each sat down. It was a perfect temperature for coming in from the cold (just under too hot to take a hearty sip—excellent and very cozy) and was salty and rich.
2. Chicken liver potato tartlet. Liver forward, which I like, but all the other flavors came through in the end. Very good.  Tempura enoki (I forgot to take the pic before I ruined the sauces). Tasty fried mushroom with some sauces. Good but nothing new or wonderful. 
3. Mushroom crostini. Amazing flavors coming from the cracker and the paste underneath the mushrooms, which were also so delicious. Salty, grain-y, umami. Loved this. Nice plate too (all the tableware was beautiful). 
4. Beets with horseradish sauce. Interesting and very tasty. 
5. Build your own lobster roll. Each piece was excellent on its own and amazing when assembled. I loved the garlic butter sauce. Nice story about the sourcing from Maine too. 
6. Turnip in ginger broth. I suppose this was a very good turnip but I don’t particularly care about turnips. The broth was so good so I would take a bite of the turnip and soak it again in the broth. Nice middle course. 
7. Komatsuna. Nice broth again—clearly a strength of the chef. Very tasty all mixed up, even if this is the kind of thing I would care less about in anticipation of more proteins. 
8. Rye and apple pancake. Super flavorful and complex, fresh fruit plus toasty, hearty grain, felt very autumn, awesome little bite and went very well with the champagne.
9. Sweet potato and pear. One of my favorite things I ate all year. Just incredibly potato-y, cooked beautifully, and the sauce was insane. 
   1. Some review earlier said nothing was seasoned? Maybe then, but not now. This might be too salty for some but perfect for me. 
10. Cauliflower picked egg yolk. Another incredible dish. The menu is building beautifully at this point and I am getting overwhelmed by how good each new thing is. This was very salty and sharp/bitter with the perfectly-cooked cauliflower plus fatty and rich with the egg yolk and sauce—powerful and balanced. Banger. 
11. Lobster tail. I started with just a bite of the lobster and was surprised (and initially a little off put) by how lightly it was cooked. It was almost raw and reminded me of another purposefully undercooked lobster I had at Table by Bruno Verjus. I didn’t love that first bite initially, on its own, but for the next bite I combined the lobster with the sauce, the vegetable, and the herby dumpling thing and was blown away. I ended up liking it more than the Table raw lobster! (Recency bias may play a role in this comparison, but they were so on par with each other. Worth keeping in mind that Table is another restaurant that gets a lot of flack but I loved.) 
12. Mushroom soup. Excellent again. No detailed notes on this one—just so many good dishes I can’t keep up with thinking about them.
13. Foie gras. The foie was amazing—a hearty amount, with great charred onions and sauce. Incredible flavor. I don’t love the mouthfeel of too much foie without something firmer or fibrous to chew on, so I could have used a bit more of those little onions or something else, but still this was incredible foie. It is also refreshing to have a truly savory foie—it is so often paired with something fruity and sweet, which I also like of course but is a bit too easy/common. The story about the sourcing was also nice—the farmer raises very few birds and takes good care of them, and this comes through in the taste of the product. 
14. Duck (same bird!). Simply put, wonderfully cooked high quality bird with great sauce. I don’t care about bok choy but this was a nice addition. 
15. Cheese. Hot cheese melted over ice cream. Awesome transition to dessert. Such amazing cheese and a great way to serve it mixing temperatures and savory/lightly sweet. Loved it. 
16. As a side note, I saw so much criticism of one of the past cheese courses, with the naysayers complaining about the presentation. I’m sorry, it’s a cheese course—how else have you seen cheese courses other than cheese on a plate? I am sure there are other presentations and approaches (such as the cheese over ice cream from Saturday!), but go to a \*\*\* in Paris and at some point they will give you a couple pieces of cheese on a plate. The sourcing, story, and flavor matter more than your ideas about how it looked. 
17. Quince and cider dessert. At this point I am quite drunk (had a couple before dinner too) and don’t have much to say about this one other than at the time I thought it fucking rocked yet again. 
18. Plum pit rosemary dessert. Great cake, mixed so well with the other elements. Awesome.
19. Chocolate. So good. Took a bite before the pic. Another nice sourcing story—you are tasting things you would not otherwise have access to, and it does add a lot to the experience for me. 
20. Petit fours. Each so tasty and a great way to end. (Photos combined because of picture limit)
21. More alcohol! (Not pictured) They offered a very interesting selection of post-dinner spirits. I really like the cadence—not trying to turn the table and get me out, very communal, hang-out, wind the evening down atmosphere. At this point I am quite full and it’s great to sit and savor it all a bit longer than in the usual tasing menu experience. And we aren’t even done!
22. Smores. The communal aspect of the dinner came together at the end as we were invited out to make smores at the fire. I chatted with the chef and the other diners and hung out for quite a while. Another very nice idea and something you wouldn’t get elsewhere. 
23. Menu.

**Wine** 

I did the wine paring. Good value for the wines you are getting, all good and thoughtful pairing choices, and nice explanations for each. I am much more food-focused but recommend the pairing.  

  

**Service**

The service was on par with the two-star and three-star restaurants I have been to. Very attentive and personable. 

Also note that when the server offered mer the welcome champagne for while we waited to get started he made it clear that this would be a supplement—so that seems like a positive adjustment, perhaps in response to fair criticism here. 

 

**Setting**  

A beautiful space, it feels communal since everyone is facing the center of the room, but spread out enough to still be intimate/private. They played good music, the bathrooms are very nice, everything smells good, etc. I also quite like the entryway and being greeted by the whole team as you enter. 

**Criticism** 

A few minor points here: The som called me earlier in the day to confirm my reservation and asked that I show up promptly at 6:50 for my 7:00 p.m. reservation. What is the point of this? There is only one seating a night! Just tell people to show up promptly at 7, the time of the reservation! It makes no difference and just adds confusion (for some! I was there at 6:50).

As you'll see they used the same green leaf in two of the different dishes. Man, I don't give a shit about that green leaf. It was fine I suppose, and but having it repeated on the menu, AND basically be the same as the bok choy (imo--my palate is not refined on these matters) was like ok fine I'll eat this again. Makes sense from a sourcing standpoint and didn't detract from the great dishes overall, so this is a very minor gripe and one particular to people like me.

The restaurant is a little bit on the bright inside. Ideally the center islands would be illuminated, as well as the food you are eating on the table, and the rest of the room a bit darker. Maybe this isn't practical, but they should check out the approaches to lighting at Oriole and Atomix. So bright it kinda felt like a cooking show or cooking class, and I imagine takes a bit away from the intimacy with ones own group. However, this could be intentional, since everyone faces the center islands anyway so it is more about that experience than being with/talking to/facing the people you are with. Another small note, not a big deal.

**Final Notes** 

I think that Feld deserves at least one star, and maybe even two, or is well on the way to the second. For comparison purposes, in October I dined at Atomix, Eleven Madison Park, and Le Bernadin (and a handful of great 1\*s in NYC in the same trip), and recently went to Alinea Group’s Next (Charlie Trotter) and FIRE. To me, this was either on par with or better than all of them. Does it seem a bit much to say Feld is as good as Atomix? Perhaps, yea. Feld has the advantages of recency bias and the fact that I walked into Atomix with 2 lbs of Katz pastrami in me (poor decision making on my part, that day) and instead went to Feld hungry. But even accounting for these I actually liked the food and overall experience at Feld just as much! Very comparable, at least. So, I loved it. Go try for yourself and let me know if you disagree!

But even accounting for these I actually liked the food and overall experience at Feld just as much! Very comparable, at least. So, I loved it. Go try for yourself and let me know if you disagree!

1giej1x,ChicagoFood,Dinner at Bistro Monadnock,"Was catching Some Like It Hot and decided to have dinner before. The Loop is usually pretty lackluster in terms of good food.

I know u/TriedForMitchcraft shouted these guys out for great fries, and so the stars aligned.

Overall, I was very pleased with dinner. It was just nice, solid bistro fare. 

We got a Gibson and a Gimlet to start. Being owned by the same group as Victor Bar / Love Street, I’d expect the cocktails to be on point and they were excellent. The Gibson was clean and stirred perfectly. The Gimlet was refreshing and light.

We started with their Bread and Butter and some Escargot. Baguette was fresh and the housemade butter was excellent. 

Escargot with puff pastry was a nice touch. I enjoyed the bit of red pepper thrown in with the  escargot butter. The puff pastry was an excellent touch to sop up extra butter. I wanted the escargot to be a touch saltier? Something was a little subdued, and while I enjoy just eating butter, something about it just wasn’t hitting the umami button that I wanted from escargot.

My wife got the gnocchi Parisienne  with chestnut mushroom, a sunchoke cream sauce, moroccan olives, marinated tomato, preserved lemon, aleppo pepper. Gnocchi was cooked perfectly, and the mix of mushroom, pepper, and tomato was divine. Totally stole the show.

Steak frite was a classic base hit. As Mitch pointed out before, their fries are money. I had an instant ratatouille moment, taking me back to the first time I had the original McDonald’s fries, fried in beef tallow. Flatiron steak was exceptionally cooked to medium rare, and the char on it was perfectly. I normally am disappointed by restaurant steak, as I can usually make better steak at home, but this was on point.

After dinner, we settled for cocktails, and I had their house made Amer Picon, which was an excellent digestif. Like the essence of a Negroni.

$200 subtotal on the dot. Expensive yes, but, again, a nice addition to the Loop. And, you get to eat in one of the most important architectural buildings in the world!",141,0.97,11.0,2024-11-02 22:56:45,restaurant,,,,"Dinner at Bistro Monadnock Was catching Some Like It Hot and decided to have dinner before.

From now until before Friday, November 22nd, we will be accepting nominations for each category and then we will post the voting poll for the top 4 most nominated in each category. The winner of the vote will be the winner of each category.

Feel free to skip any nominations if there are categories you don't have strong feelings about. We know this is the internet so we are reserving the right to reject any movements to nominate nonsensical responses (like Rainforest Cafe for best overall restaurant or Red Hot Ranch for best tasting menu) sorry but we would like these to be taken at least somewhat seriously lol. We also reserve the right to reject a nomination if it's clear that a place with a large following just asked everyone to submit nominations for that place and we get 500 responses that just nominate that restaurant and nothing else or anything that looks like clear vote manipulation.

The goal of this is to provide additional support to our favorite restaurants. It will also be nice if people ask for the best burger or pizza and we can say ""X, Y, and Z were nominated for best burger last year""

1gnm2p3,ChicagoFood,The Briny Swine Smokehouse,"Hello everyone,

I have seen this restaurant has become a bit popular with locals, however, I feel it is our duty as consumers to know when something is wrong.

The owners of this restaurant used to operate two others in a small vacation town near Charleston called Edisto on Edisto Island. One of the restaurants bore the same name as the establishment now here in Chicago. While another, considered more upscale, was called Ella and Ollies.

Why does this matter, you ask?

I'll tell you why.

Without saying a word to their employees at both restaurants, the owners packed up and left to Chicsgo and opened this new location. They stopped paying rent on their former locations, they stopped paying bills, and ultimately they stopped paying their employees. Checks bounced and many were left without pay but continued working until they couldn't anymore and the City shut down the restaurants.

I will be linking the Edisto local newspaper with the article as well as providing an image of the article as well.

1. Scenic Views: Ideally, the restaurant is located on a higher floor or offers beautiful views while you enjoy your tea.


2. Bang for the Buck: Not looking for anything ridiculously expensive, but if it is pricey, I’d want it to be absolutely worth it.


3. Great Spread: A solid selection of teas and treats, where everything tastes as good as it looks!


4. Kid-Friendly: I’ll have my two kids with me, so it’d be nice if the cost for them isn’t too high and the atmosphere isn’t overly stiff.


5. Excellent Service: Hoping for a warm and welcoming experience from the staff for our anniversary

1gt43bu,ChicagoFood,Tasting menu at Bayan Ko (November 2024).,"I went for the tasting menu at Bayan Ko after a few people here suggested adding it to my list. I’m not very familiar with Filipino/Cuban food, so I was excited to try something new! **8/10 overall.**

**Food - 8.** To me, this tasted like food made by family, for family - but fancier. The dishes were hearty and comforting, with bold, warm, tropical flavors and an enjoyable variety of proteins and textures. There weren't a ton of courses but the portions were generous so I left satisfied. Was everything perfect? No, but I still really enjoyed my meal. It felt like going over to a good friend’s house and having her mom (who also happens to be a chef) whip up something special yet homey for dinner.

**Drinks - 8.5.** I had a non-alcoholic sangria and peach rooibos tea, both of which were refreshing and complemented the food well.

**Service - 9.** There were just a couple people taking care of the entire place, but they were welcoming and attentive. My server introduced the dishes with enthusiasm and pride, which honestly made me appreciate the food more. The pacing of the courses was a little bit slow but seemed consistent throughout the restaurant.

**Ambiance - 7.** The restaurant felt like a casual, laidback café, with an eclectic blend of colorful murals, plants, and neon signs creating a cozy atmosphere. This seemed like a very popular date night spot based on the guests who visited while I was there. The music was pleasant and not too loud. The only thing I didn’t like was the seating, which was those ubiquitous, trendy, stupidly uncomfortable metal chairs.

**Would I go again?** Yes, if they changed their menu to include new dishes. Otherwise, I’d like to try their companion restaurant, Bayan Ko Diner, instead.

","Monteverde has been on our list of ‘we need to try it!’ restaurants for a while, but we wanted to ensure we did it with a small group to enable us to try the biggest variety of dishes.  We visited this weekend with two other couples.  Everyone was extremely impressed!



We had the Burrata, a daily special wagyu bruschetta, gnocchetti con pesto, cacio whey pepe, prime Black Angus strip steak w/black truffle, Ragu Alla Napiletana, citrus dark chocolate sundae, butterscotch budino, and forgotten cookie.

  

Every single dish was a hit.  I say that and mean it.  We’ve done tons of dinners together where several dishes were hits, or it was an ‘everything was great, that dish was only okay’, or whatever.  But literally every one of us really enjoyed every dish we tasted, and almost everyone tasted almost every dish.

  

The highlights to me were the Burrata and the Ragu Alla Napoletana.  Both were amazing, and the tigelles were something I’d not had before.  The Italian sausage in the Ragu was maybe the best I’ve ever had.  



All six of us left saying it was the best dinner we’d had in a very long time, we were all surprised by how flavorful every dish was, how no dish was a ‘miss’ or even ‘mid’, and that we couldn’t wait to come back.  



The service was also very good.   Our waiter, Alex B, did a great job of giving suggestions and input without being too involved, and all of his suggestions (for quantity of food, number of each item to order, and even suggesting not ordering a certain dish as it was so close to another we ordered) were spot on. 






While I don’t have any new revelations for the Monteverde crowd, I’ll simply comment that I see why the hype is there, and it lived up to our very high expectations.

All six of us left saying it was the best dinner we’d had in a very long time, we were all surprised by how flavorful every dish was, how no dish was a ‘miss’ or even ‘mid’, and that we couldn’t wait to come back.  



The service was also very good.   Our waiter, Alex B, did a great job of giving suggestions and input without being too involved, and all of his suggestions (for quantity of food, number of each item to order, and even suggesting not ordering a certain dish as it was so close to another we ordered) were spot on.

1ghn9rw,ChicagoFood,Tasting menu at Oriole (November 2024).,"I went for the tasting menu at Oriole and had a wonderful meal. **9.25/10 overall.**

**Food - 9.** The food was absolutely delicious for the most part. There were many bites that were real standouts (all 4 starters, the tomato accompanying the lobster, capellini, wagyu, and rosemary), but this made me more critical of the courses which didn't quite live up to those bold flavors. The plates were colorful and attractive without being challenging to consume. I also sprung for the seasonal white truffle supplement ($125). I thought it was a great addition to the capellini course but felt betrayed by the dessert add-on which just tasted overwhelmingly (and tragically) like banana to me. The textures were amazing though, so as long as you don't hate banana like I do, you'll probably love it.

**Drinks - 9.** I opted for the non-alcoholic beverage pairing and it was fantastic. Nearly all the drinks were pleasing in appearance, scent, and texture on their own. They all had creative, complex flavor profiles which paired perfectly with the food and never felt boring. The drinks were a little sweet for my preference (I generally prefer citrusy, dry, or crisp beverages) but not unpalatably so. I also ordered tea along with the dessert courses based on my server's recommendation, and that was also nice.

**Service - 10.** The hospitality was exceptional. All of the staff were warm and welcoming and happy to engage by answering questions, making recommendations, and sharing their favorite parts of the meal. Service was prompt and professional yet still felt relaxed.

**Ambiance - 8.5.** This was an interesting experience. You start off in an antique, industrial-looking elevator which doubles as a foyer. You're then gradually escorted through a few distinct areas of the restaurant while being served some small bites along the way to your final destination. It felt a little contrived, but I still enjoyed seeing the different spaces, and these were some of the best courses, so no complaints there. The actual dining room had dark, moody lighting and music which was almost too loud at times. This was my least favorite spot in terms of decor, but it was still clean and comfortable, and I liked being able to peek into the open kitchen from my table.

**Note:** The bill includes a 20% service charge which covers gratuity. This is automatically added when booking your reservation in advance online, but not to anything purchased directly at the restaurant.

**Would I go again?** Yes.

1gnt93j,ChicagoFood,Tasting menu at Schwa (November 2024).,"I went for the tasting menu at Schwa and had a fun time. **7.5/10 overall.**

**Food - 7.5.** As with many experimental restaurants, this was hit-or-miss. But the food was *never* boring. There were several courses that I enjoyed immensely (raviolo, à la mode, quail, cheese, float) but also a couple that were complete misses for me (ramen, fluff, tea). Opinion was divided across our table, though, so your perception of the food will depend on your palate and what appeals to you personally. Although I didn't love everything I ate, I still really appreciated the chefs' creativity and fearlessness when it came to bold flavors, interesting textures, and unusual combinations. The portions were on the smaller side, so if you have a big appetite, you might walk away hungry. I left decently full, but I would've liked larger plates to be able to explore the dishes better - there were so many interesting components, but many were in such small quantities that I couldn't mix and match and assemble multiple bites with them. Finally, many of the dishes are eaten with your hands rather than utensils, so if that bothers you, plan accordingly.

**Drinks - N/A.** The restaurant is BYOB. We went overboard with drinks so our table ended up overcrowded with bottles, but that's our fault. They offered us a complimentary round of shots (whiskey or tea) at the end of the meal, which was a pleasant surprise.

**Service - 7.5.** You're on your own for the most part as the servers are also the chefs busy preparing your meal. As such, the pacing was a little inconsistent, sometimes rather fast and occasionally a bit slow, but not too noticeable if you're with good company. The introductions to each course were impressively descriptive, and the chefs were happy to answer questions and offer suggestions on the best way to approach each dish. (Lastly, although I'm not factoring it into my rating since these interactions took place outside of our dining experience, I think this still deserves acknowledgement and appreciation: the restaurant was very helpful and quick to respond when I reached out about scheduling, dietary restrictions, and recommendations for beverage pairings.)

**Ambiance - 6.** This is a no-frills, unpretentious dining experience. It's dark and can get quite loud between the upbeat music and conversation of nearby guests. I wouldn't recommend visiting as a solo diner or a party that prefers formality, but it was a great atmosphere for a casual social outing. I'd say the vibe leans much more towards a bustling bar than pompous fine dining.

**Note:** The bill includes a 20% service charge (covering gratuity) which is disclosed upfront when making the reservation. You don't receive any sort of bill at the restaurant.

**Would I go again?** Yes, I want to support restaurants that aren't afraid to innovate. I'd come back with friends if they introduced enough new dishes.

Recently heard about Chef Carlos Garza turning their old seafood counter in the back into a chef counter experience with a traditional kamal and curiosity got the best of me. I’m glad it did.

The price for this is $149/person which I found completely reasonable for the amount of food and quality of ingredients (I was already full going into the 8th course, so I’m glad desserts were on the lighter side). Things I’d nitpick: the yucca chips for a couple of the dishes weren’t perfectly crunchy, the katafi wrapping on the coconut shrimp could’ve been slightly thinner, the desserts could’ve been slightly less alcohol-forward (the pineapples in rum syrup were pretty overpowering for someone who doesn’t drink - but this is a personal preference).

1gy5y1g,ChicagoFood,"Aye, mi Cariño! Tacomakase at was an awesome experience.","Treated myself last night to the 10 pm seating of the Taco Omakase at Cariño and overall I would highly recommend! 

I love food / dining out, but don’t like assigning a star or point value to the experience. I’m not a food critic; I don’t need to split hairs. My system is a simple “Go” or “Don’t Go”. Cariño is a definite Go. 

Menu:

-Michelada Oyster
-Ora King Salmon and Mango Aguachile
-Lamb Tartar Tostada
-Blue Corn Tetela
-Mushroom Quesadilla w Truffle 
-Gulf Shrimp Taco w Peanut Salsa
-Suadero Taco
-Wagyu Beef Taco
-Mango Sorbet

I’m also doing a disservice by not properly remembering every detail of the dishes; the chefs did a fantastic job of engaging with the diners and explaining everything along the way. My favorites were the Michelada Oyster and Salmon Aguachile—the contrasting textures and flavors were so interesting. 

Price: 

$125 for the reservation and with a 25% gratuity charge and tax, the total is $175. I also got a 3rd cocktail for $18 and paid an extra $25 for the supplemental truffle on top of the quesadilla. With two cocktails included in the $175, I felt I got a fair value for the meal and experience. 

Chef Norman was super friendly as well, really cool chatting with him in between courses. Fun to sit at the counter and see the chefs work up close. Interestingly, an episode for a food documentary was being filmed so keep your eyes peeled for Cariño to pop up. The details were still undisclosed, even the restaurant didn’t know the title of the show. ",40,0.85,7.0,2024-11-23 12:14:32,restaurant,,,,"Aye, mi Cariño! Tacomakase at was an awesome experience.

It was chaos in there -- the guy at the register seemed confused about how the register/discounts worked, the guy behind the bar didn't know how to work the taps and was unable to pour a beer, the one waitress on staff would just burst out of the kitchen and shout out the order (it seemed like no one was communicating to her what tables ordered what?) and they were out of most things on the menu. The floor was a total disaster too, with pieces of pizza and receipts everywhere. We were served our food on paper plates, which is totally fine but was not the case before they re-opened.

Did they close and fire all of the old employees and then quickly reopen with an untrained skeleton crew? Why? I can't see them lasting too long like this but would love the scoop if anyone knows whats going on.

1gmaiak,ChicagoFood,Omakase Yume x Bonyeon: Counter Culture (November 2024).,"I went to the limited-time collaboration between Omakase Yume and Bonyeon for a 17-course tasting menu intended to showcase the best of both omakase experiences. **8/10 overall.**

Please note that I attended the first service on the opening night of this brand new event, so they have likely already learned from this experience and will improve going forward. The event lasts until November 10, so you still have a chance to snag a seat.

**Food - 8.** Most of the dishes presented were highlights from each restaurant's menu and therefore were obviously wonderful. The menu delivered Korean-inspired dishes with a wide variety of flavors, textures, and techniques which kept the meal fresh and interesting (no small feat for 17 courses). Several new dishes were added just for this collaboration, however, and could use some refinement in my opinion. The flavors were still delicious for the most part, but small, easily-remedied details like awkward tableware or odd presentation detracted from some dishes or occasionally made them challenging to consume. Another thing which needs to be addressed is consistency in steak preparation - those courses were prepared tableside by three different chefs, and I observed noticeable differences in the cook on the meat, plating, and subsequent timing with which they were delivered to guests. Again, these were relatively minor issues, but resolving them will significantly elevate the entire experience.

**Drinks - N/A.** I ordered the yuzu kukicha tea and it was pleasant. The staff kept topping me up so I probably drank an entire teapot or two over the course of the night.

**Service - 8.** Perhaps because it was their very first combined service, the staff and chefs seemed a bit nervous. The staff were prompt and attentive throughout the meal, but the closely-spaced counter seating made it difficult at times for them to provide unobtrusive service. The food was prepared and presented by several chefs, who appeared to have differing comfort levels with formally describing the dishes. I would've liked to hear more about some courses since the menu was not shared upfront. The chef serving my particular section of the counter was clearly knowledgeable and passionate about his job, but just seemed to prefer answering questions and sharing details spontaneously. The pacing and serving of courses was a little off until the chefs found their rhythm. I expect that will improve as the event progresses.

**Ambiance - 8.** I enjoyed the overall ambiance of the restaurant (Bonyeon), which balances a dark and moody interior with a brightly-lit counter to create an intimate atmosphere. The restaurant was sensibly designed to put its steak omakase front and center, with grills built directly into the counter. I enjoyed watching the chefs create those courses, but felt somewhat disappointed that I couldn't really see the other preparations happening deeper in the open kitchen. That was one of my favorite aspects of my prior visit to Omakase Yume. The vibe of this dinner was much livelier than my meal at Omakase Yume, with guests chatting freely with one another while the chefs focused on their work. I haven't been to Bonyeon on its own, so I'm not sure how this experience compares.

**Note:** The prepaid reservation does not include an automatic gratuity, but anything purchased at the restaurant comes with a 20% service charge.

**Would I go again?** While I enjoyed my meal, one visit was enough to accomplish my goal of sampling the best of each omakase. I probably wouldn't come back unless the menu changed significantly so I could try new dishes. I will wait to visit Bonyeon until I feel they've settled in and are more consistent.

They provided me with a dedicated support staff member (again we didn't ask for or pay for this...they just provided it and I was so thankful for it) whose entire job was to bring me drinks and food, check in that everything was as my husband and I wanted it, and she even helped bustle my dress. Cost for a buyout was super reasonable...it was just a food/bev minimum that covered everything including the food/bev obviously but also the space, staff, etc.

1gj26kr,ChicagoFood,Chicago Pizza Summit was horrible. ,"I made a post last week asking who was going and a lot of people said the vendors sucked and didn’t seem worth it. I went last year, and last year was bad but this year was so much worse it was unbelievable. 

Issues this year:
 
- Vendors sucked, there were maybe three good vendors out of the 8-9. It was so obvious who the good vendors were because they had the longest lines in the venue. It is a huge downgrade from vendors last year, with over 12 vendors, and majority of them being good, this year was a massive disappointment. 

- There was no line control, and honest to god, it felt like the space was too small. Too many people waiting in these long lines because vendors quickly ran out of pizza. You can feel everyone’s annoyance. Especially since we all paid $70 to be there. 

- The drink selection sucks. They had the worst seltzers ever and even worse wine and beer selection. Everyone at the bar complained so much people just paid the $13 for a cocktail. 

- Pizzas took forever to come out. And I understand they were sharing ovens and only had so many. But there are so many better ways to provide oven and resources for vendors, and for the 6th year of this happening. I can’t believe they haven’t figured it out. 

- Last but very petty point, it was way too dark in there. You will see by my photos. 

The only positive was the infused pizza. A slice with about 4 mg of THC was very nice!

Overall, I will not be back unless I am invited. I refuse to pay money for something this unorganized. ",682,0.96,197.0,2024-11-03 18:51:27,venue,,,,"Chicago Pizza Summit was horrible.

There was limited oven space and the venue had problems with electric power.

1ghn9rw,ChicagoFood,Tasting menu at Oriole (November 2024).,"I went for the tasting menu at Oriole and had a wonderful meal. **9.25/10 overall.**

**Food - 9.** The food was absolutely delicious for the most part. There were many bites that were real standouts (all 4 starters, the tomato accompanying the lobster, capellini, wagyu, and rosemary), but this made me more critical of the courses which didn't quite live up to those bold flavors. The plates were colorful and attractive without being challenging to consume. I also sprung for the seasonal white truffle supplement ($125). I thought it was a great addition to the capellini course but felt betrayed by the dessert add-on which just tasted overwhelmingly (and tragically) like banana to me. The textures were amazing though, so as long as you don't hate banana like I do, you'll probably love it.

**Drinks - 9.** I opted for the non-alcoholic beverage pairing and it was fantastic. Nearly all the drinks were pleasing in appearance, scent, and texture on their own. They all had creative, complex flavor profiles which paired perfectly with the food and never felt boring. The drinks were a little sweet for my preference (I generally prefer citrusy, dry, or crisp beverages) but not unpalatably so. I also ordered tea along with the dessert courses based on my server's recommendation, and that was also nice.

**Service - 10.** The hospitality was exceptional. All of the staff were warm and welcoming and happy to engage by answering questions, making recommendations, and sharing their favorite parts of the meal. Service was prompt and professional yet still felt relaxed.

**Ambiance - 8.5.** This was an interesting experience. You start off in an antique, industrial-looking elevator which doubles as a foyer. You're then gradually escorted through a few distinct areas of the restaurant while being served some small bites along the way to your final destination. It felt a little contrived, but I still enjoyed seeing the different spaces, and these were some of the best courses, so no complaints there. The actual dining room had dark, moody lighting and music which was almost too loud at times. This was my least favorite spot in terms of decor, but it was still clean and comfortable, and I liked being able to peek into the open kitchen from my table.

**Note:** The bill includes a 20% service charge which covers gratuity. This is automatically added when booking your reservation in advance online, but not to anything purchased directly at the restaurant.

**Would I go again?** Yes.

I went for the tasting menu at Oriole and had a wonderful meal. **9.25/10 overall.**

**Food - 9.** The food was absolutely delicious for the most part. There were many bites that were real standouts (all 4 starters, the tomato accompanying the lobster, capellini, wagyu, and rosemary), but this made me more critical of the courses which didn't quite live up to those bold flavors. The plates were colorful and attractive without being challenging to consume. I also sprung for the seasonal white truffle supplement ($125). I thought it was a great addition to the capellini course but felt betrayed by the dessert add-on which just tasted overwhelmingly (and tragically) like banana to me. The textures were amazing though, so as long as you don't hate banana like I do, you'll probably love it.

**Drinks - 9.** I opted for the non-alcoholic beverage pairing and it was fantastic. Nearly all the drinks were pleasing in appearance, scent, and texture on their own. They all had creative, complex flavor profiles which paired perfectly with the food and never felt boring. The drinks were a little sweet for my preference (I generally prefer citrusy, dry, or crisp beverages) but not unpalatably so. I also ordered tea along with the dessert courses based on my server's recommendation, and that was also nice.

**Service - 10.** The hospitality was exceptional. All of the staff were warm and welcoming and happy to engage by answering questions, making recommendations, and sharing their favorite parts of the meal. Service was prompt and professional yet still felt relaxed.

**Ambiance - 8.5.** This was an interesting experience. You start off in an antique, industrial-looking elevator which doubles as a foyer. You're then gradually escorted through a few distinct areas of the restaurant while being served some small bites along the way to your final destination. It felt a little contrived, but I still enjoyed seeing the different spaces, and these were some of the best courses, so no complaints there. The actual dining room had dark, moody lighting and music which was almost too loud at times. This was my least favorite spot in terms of decor, but it was still clean and comfortable, and I liked being able to peek into the open kitchen from my table.

**Note:** The bill includes a 20% service charge which covers gratuity. This is automatically added when booking your reservation in advance online, but not to anything purchased directly at the restaurant.

**Would I go again?** Yes.

It is a huge downgrade from vendors last year, with over 12 vendors, and majority of them being good, this year was a massive disappointment. 

- There was no line control, and honest to god, it felt like the space was too small. Too many people waiting in these long lines because vendors quickly ran out of pizza. You can feel everyone’s annoyance. Especially since we all paid $70 to be there. 

- The drink selection sucks. They had the worst seltzers ever and even worse wine and beer selection. Everyone at the bar complained so much people just paid the $13 for a cocktail. 

- Pizzas took forever to come out. And I understand they were sharing ovens and only had so many. But there are so many better ways to provide oven and resources for vendors, and for the 6th year of this happening. I can’t believe they haven’t figured it out. 

- Last but very petty point, it was way too dark in there. You will see by my photos. 

The only positive was the infused pizza. A slice with about 4 mg of THC was very nice!

Friday night - Three Dots and a Dash (specifically the Bamboo Room speakeasy) for delicious tiki drinks in a fun environment. Got the Port Light and it was super booze forward, but so well made with premium spirits. Love!

Saturday morning - Au Cheval for brunch and got their single burger and added egg and bacon. Super indulgent and the bacon was phenomenal. Was quoted a 45 min wait, but it really took 20.

Lunch - Mr. Beef and I got the classic Italian Beef Sandwich and my god. I wish we had some of these here in Austin, TX where I’m from. The line looked long, but it was so efficient that I was in & out in no time.

Dinner - Oriole, specifically the Chef’s Table experience. First time at a 2* Michelin restaurant and each course was a thoughtful exploration of flavors and textures from French & Japanese cuisines. The Foie Gras toast was my favorite.

Sunday noon - I waited for 2 hours to try Kasama and… it’s hard to be mad. I should’ve ordered online as the in-person experience was nothing special, but the pastries were amazing - the Ham & Cheese Danish was my favorite.

Dinner - If you head to the airport from downtown, Pequod’s Pizza is just a 3-min detour. I placed a pickup order and they had some tables there for you to dine-in. This spot was the TRUTH! The caramelized crust was a welcome touch.

1h26sqt,ChicagoFood,Perilla might have changed my life,"## Premise
Last week I’ve visited this amazing city for a business trip and added a couple of days before and after the convention. Thank you company I work for

As a proper foodie, and something which you all might do, I’ve seen scouting Reddit, IG, the internet, asking friends about the best places to eat in Chicago. In the end I’ve constructed a list of 68 places to eat and drink. In 8 days. Let’s go

## honorary mentions
**Dearborn**
What an amazing atmosphere this place has. Very classy, very cozy. Our waiter Cooper was down to earth, attentive and an all round great guy. I’ve worked for 10ish years in the service industry I recognize a great one. He certainly is.

The food: splendid. Everything had the perfect balance and tasted amazing. From the meze to the steaks. Best thing on the menu: fried chicken with honey glazed. Pure perfection 

**Bavette’s**
This place had such a good ambiance. Went downstairs to the private room and the whole vibe is such a treat. We had steaks with some sides and were completely stuffed

Classic Chicago Ribeye and my colleagues both had the dry aged bone in NY strip. Probably one of the best steaks I’ve had in my life. 

## Perilla
Let’s get down to business. Last dinner of the trip and we were on the hunt for a place to eat. During lunch we were on a mission to make it a memorable one. However, no reservations yet on a Saturday evening? Chances of getting something nice: slim to none.

While at Cindy’s having a couple of cocktails, Perilla so happened to have a table left at 9 PM. Already a win. Being the one that compiled the exhaustive list of restaurants, I was more than happy we got in.

Arriving a tad early, we were seated at the bar for a couple of old fashioned’s. Great ambiance, maybe a bit less than Dearborn or Bavette, but great nonetheless. Our server was splendid, she did such a great job. Pure professionalism. 

**The food**
For starters: Snow Crab, oysters and giant Shrimps with Foie Gras on blueberry toast, and Korean Steak Tartare with fried seaweed. These were all soooo good. Steak tartare with fried seaweed? Amazing find. 

As the mains: Korean fried chicken, the steakhouse set for two which was accompanied by 3 different kinds of kimchi, the grilled mushrooms and kimchi fried rice.

Ok, I’m from Europe. We don’t really deal in superlatives all that much. However, listen to me: KIMCHI FRIED RICE. You need to understand that this might have been the best dish I’ve eaten. As in: final meal on my resting bed territory. First time since a very long time I’ve been this much surprised by a meal. Just simply out of this world. 

Lastly: the Korean fried chicken. How on earth did they get it like that? Crunchy exterior and a soft and delicate inside. Again, just wow. These two dishes are easily in the top 10 of dishes I’ve had in my life.

I’ve read so much about this amazing place so please accept my humble review. Great city, amazing vibe and even better food. Will be back! ",454,0.96,22.0,2024-11-28 15:58:44,drinks,,,,"Perilla might have changed my life ## Premise

Pros: 

- Tacos were very good and they give you a lot of meat. They are not stingy at all with the toppings either. I preferred the steak over the chicken. 
- Good spicy red salsa, a lot of places these days don’t sell spicy salsas anymore. There is a war on spicy foods:broken_heart:
- Marg was very good and cheap ($10) for how big it was. I didn’t know they sold liquor and was surprised to see it on the menu. 
- Guac was good, seasoned and not too much lime or salt. 
- Good service, the two women ran that place like the navy and were very kind!

Cons:
- Chicken taco is ehh, okay. I feel like a lot of Mexican spots chicken tends to be dry. Maybe that is how it is traditionally. I’m not Mexican so please correct me if I’m wrong. The chicken was seasoned though so it made up for it a little. 
- Horrible rice, just not seasoned at all. Makes me sad when Mexican spots have bad rice. Next time I’ll just get fries or nothing at all. 
- Marg wasn’t strong. But for $10 I never expected it to be. I know they have stronger drinks on the menu so next time I will try something else. 
- It is cold in there, but I also sat by the window so if you get easily cold, don’t make the same mistake as me.

1gryzj4,ChicagoFood,Oaxaca: The Feast of the 7 Moles tasting menu at Topolobampo (November 2024).,"I went to the current tasting menu at Topolobampo with high expectations and left a little disappointed. **6.5/10 overall.**

Before I get into my experience, I want to emphasize that all restaurants have off nights. I hope this just happened to be one of them and that other people have a more enjoyable time than I did. If you went for this menu and had a great time, I’d love to hear about it.

**Food - 7.** I love bold, complex flavors, so I was really excited for a menu dedicated entirely to moles. The moles themselves were pretty delicious, yet somehow most of the dishes ended up tasting just okay. In my opinion, it was sometimes a lack of balance, or an odd texture, or too many competing elements on the plate which ended up detracting from the overall dish. In sharp contrast, the mole negro with 3 different cuts of wagyu was spectacular (minus the accompaniments) - so the potential to wow is absolutely there. Dinner also came with several surprise additions, which were some of the best bites of the night.

**Drinks - 4.** This one is kind of funny and mostly my fault. I'm not much of a drinker but I decided to try something new and unusual (for me) and opted for the agave pairing because it sounded intriguing. I then promptly discovered that I don't enjoy agave spirits in large quantities, as they disrupt my palate and also don’t agree with my stomach… So needless to say, I didn’t enjoy the pairing at all. I found it hard to appreciate the nuances in the drinks beyond the overwhelming burning sensation, and what little I could discern didn’t seem to complement or enhance the food at all. On the other hand, I quite enjoyed the non-alcoholic paloma highball I purchased in the lounge to accompany the appetizers. That bright and refreshing drink singlehandedly salvaged this rating from a 0. I wish I would’ve stuck to cocktails throughout the evening instead.

**Service - 6.** Most of the staff were friendly and enthusiastic, so I feel bad about this score, but there were some significant issues with service overall. The pacing was incredibly slow, not only at my table, but throughout the entire dining room. It was to the point where guests appeared visibly uncomfortable. There were only 6 courses listed on the menu, but with the addition of some surprise appetizers and small bites, the experience lasted around 2.5 hours, most of which was spent waiting. The timing of courses was also strange, with collisions between the staff trying to present pairings and dishes simultaneously and inconsistencies in how things were served. The staff seemed to struggle to recall details of the courses at times, which is surprising given that this menu isn't new. It was also very hard to hear them speak over the loud music. Service wavered between overbearing (constantly asking if everything was okay) and nonexistent (needing to flag someone down to ask for more water). For me, the most disappointing part of the meal was when they forgot to serve a supplement I’d ordered in advance; they apologized and refunded me, but the experience was very awkward. My final bill was also inaccurate (in my favor), so I recommend double-checking before you pay.

**Ambiance - 6.5.** I liked the space itself, though the tables felt weirdly claustrophobic in their spacing. The decor was warm, the art was interesting, and the seats were comfortable. What I didn’t like was how loud the music was - it was extremely challenging for me to hear the servers describe the courses, and I missed a lot of details. It was also somewhat cold despite being fairly close to the kitchen. But worst of all was the palpable awkwardness lingering throughout the dining room as we all patiently waited and waited for our next course.

**Note:** The bill includes a 20% service charge (that covers gratuity) when booking online. This charge is not automatically applied to anything extra you order at the restaurant.

**Would I go again?** I don’t think so… Not unless there was a menu I absolutely couldn’t resist.

And now for photos. Please excuse the quality (even worse than usual); the lighting left much to be desired.

1gw8x42,ChicagoFood,Tasting menu at Valhalla (November 2024).,"I went for the tasting menu at Valhalla and yes, it really *was* that good. **9.5/10 overall.**

**Food - 9.25.** Personally, I loved it, but I don't think this menu will be a hit for everyone. It's a lot to eat, leans towards seafood (7/13 savory bites), has a distinct Asian flair, and includes some very intense flavor profiles. My favorite courses were the leng saeb-inspired beef breast and mixed seafood ceviche from the ""surf"" trio, which both had super bright, acidic, tangy components that I found delicious and refreshing. I enjoyed the rest of the menu as well and thought the only miss was the local vegetable gazpacho, which wasn't terrible, but just nowhere near the level of everything else. I also was impressed with the variety and execution of the dessert courses, and look forward to trying the rest of the tiny chocolates I had to take home.

**Drinks - 9.5.** This was a very pleasant surprise! I opted for the ""anything but wine"" beverage pairing and the bartender knocked it out of the park. Again, I think this was a happy coincidence of the flavors and alcohols happening to really suit my tastes. I love drinks that are fruity, citrusy, sharp, sour, or effervescent, and many of the cocktails and ciders were precisely that. Perhaps too much so for a normal person. My favorite cocktail included calamansi, caraway seeds, and dill salt, which sounds incredibly weird and *was* weird but also amazing and the best, most unique drink I've had this year. 

**Service - 10.** The seating is all at the chef's counter. Initially, it was very quiet and a little awkward as I was the only guest and was seated facing a mostly-empty kitchen while the chefs focused on their work along the other section of the counter.

",41,0.96,29.0,2024-11-20 23:26:36,drinks,,,,"Tasting menu at Valhalla (November 2024). I went for the tasting menu at Valhalla and yes, it really *was* that good. **9.5/10 overall.**

**Food - 9.25.** Personally, I loved it, but I don't think this menu will be a hit for everyone. It's a lot to eat, leans towards seafood (7/13 savory bites), has a distinct Asian flair, and includes some very intense flavor profiles. My favorite courses were the leng saeb-inspired beef breast and mixed seafood ceviche from the ""surf"" trio, which both had super bright, acidic, tangy components that I found delicious and refreshing. I enjoyed the rest of the menu as well and thought the only miss was the local vegetable gazpacho, which wasn't terrible, but just nowhere near the level of everything else. I also was impressed with the variety and execution of the dessert courses, and look forward to trying the rest of the tiny chocolates I had to take home.

**Drinks - 9.5.** This was a very pleasant surprise! I opted for the ""anything but wine"" beverage pairing and the bartender knocked it out of the park. Again, I think this was a happy coincidence of the flavors and alcohols happening to really suit my tastes. I love drinks that are fruity, citrusy, sharp, sour, or effervescent, and many of the cocktails and ciders were precisely that. Perhaps too much so for a normal person. My favorite cocktail included calamansi, caraway seeds, and dill salt, which sounds incredibly weird and *was* weird but also amazing and the best, most unique drink I've had this year. 

**Service - 10.** The seating is all at the chef's counter. Initially, it was very quiet and a little awkward as I was the only guest and was seated facing a mostly-empty kitchen while the chefs focused on their work along the other section of the counter. But my main server was welcoming and personable, as were the bartender and chefs once we actually began interacting. Everyone was extremely knowledgeable and happy to answer questions about the dishes and share interesting stories or recommendations. The service and presentation was highly polished and the staff clearly strive for perfection and pay close attention to detail.

**Ambiance - 8.5.** I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this. The decor was certainly interesting, and the lighting was moody and dramatic. I felt a little sorry for the chefs who seemed to be cooking in the dark. The background music was upbeat and electronic, but not too loud or distracting. It was fairly cold in the restaurant, but everything was immaculate and fortunately more comfortable than it looked.

1gt43bu,ChicagoFood,Tasting menu at Bayan Ko (November 2024).,"I went for the tasting menu at Bayan Ko after a few people here suggested adding it to my list. I’m not very familiar with Filipino/Cuban food, so I was excited to try something new! **8/10 overall.**

**Food - 8.** To me, this tasted like food made by family, for family - but fancier. The dishes were hearty and comforting, with bold, warm, tropical flavors and an enjoyable variety of proteins and textures. There weren't a ton of courses but the portions were generous so I left satisfied. Was everything perfect? No, but I still really enjoyed my meal. It felt like going over to a good friend’s house and having her mom (who also happens to be a chef) whip up something special yet homey for dinner.

**Drinks - 8.5.** I had a non-alcoholic sangria and peach rooibos tea, both of which were refreshing and complemented the food well.

**Service - 9.** There were just a couple people taking care of the entire place, but they were welcoming and attentive. My server introduced the dishes with enthusiasm and pride, which honestly made me appreciate the food more. The pacing of the courses was a little bit slow but seemed consistent throughout the restaurant.

**Ambiance - 7.** The restaurant felt like a casual, laidback café, with an eclectic blend of colorful murals, plants, and neon signs creating a cozy atmosphere. This seemed like a very popular date night spot based on the guests who visited while I was there. The music was pleasant and not too loud. The only thing I didn’t like was the seating, which was those ubiquitous, trendy, stupidly uncomfortable metal chairs.

**Would I go again?** Yes, if they changed their menu to include new dishes. Otherwise, I’d like to try their companion restaurant, Bayan Ko Diner, instead.

1ghn9rw,ChicagoFood,Tasting menu at Oriole (November 2024).,"I went for the tasting menu at Oriole and had a wonderful meal. **9.25/10 overall.**

**Food - 9.** The food was absolutely delicious for the most part. There were many bites that were real standouts (all 4 starters, the tomato accompanying the lobster, capellini, wagyu, and rosemary), but this made me more critical of the courses which didn't quite live up to those bold flavors. The plates were colorful and attractive without being challenging to consume. I also sprung for the seasonal white truffle supplement ($125). I thought it was a great addition to the capellini course but felt betrayed by the dessert add-on which just tasted overwhelmingly (and tragically) like banana to me. The textures were amazing though, so as long as you don't hate banana like I do, you'll probably love it.

**Drinks - 9.** I opted for the non-alcoholic beverage pairing and it was fantastic. Nearly all the drinks were pleasing in appearance, scent, and texture on their own. They all had creative, complex flavor profiles which paired perfectly with the food and never felt boring. The drinks were a little sweet for my preference (I generally prefer citrusy, dry, or crisp beverages) but not unpalatably so. I also ordered tea along with the dessert courses based on my server's recommendation, and that was also nice.

**Service - 10.** The hospitality was exceptional. All of the staff were warm and welcoming and happy to engage by answering questions, making recommendations, and sharing their favorite parts of the meal. Service was prompt and professional yet still felt relaxed.

**Ambiance - 8.5.** This was an interesting experience. You start off in an antique, industrial-looking elevator which doubles as a foyer. You're then gradually escorted through a few distinct areas of the restaurant while being served some small bites along the way to your final destination. It felt a little contrived, but I still enjoyed seeing the different spaces, and these were some of the best courses, so no complaints there. The actual dining room had dark, moody lighting and music which was almost too loud at times. This was my least favorite spot in terms of decor, but it was still clean and comfortable, and I liked being able to peek into the open kitchen from my table.

**Note:** The bill includes a 20% service charge which covers gratuity. This is automatically added when booking your reservation in advance online, but not to anything purchased directly at the restaurant.

**Would I go again?** Yes.

1h2agaq,ChicagoFood,A Very Merry Hawksmoor Thanksgiving!,"Decided to do a solo Thanksgiving at the bar at Hawksmoor today! 

Arrived around 4 without a reservation and was able to get a spot at the bar (my preference). I’ve been once before, with a group, for Sunday roast. 

I got the Prime Rib Roast thanksgiving special ($68) — all the usual Sunday roast trimmings but with a nice slice of prime rib.  The carrots, roasted garlic & cabbage were outstanding.  I honestly have no notes.  The Yorkshire pudding was good but maybe not the most stellar Yorkshire I’ve ever had.  The prime rib was delicious and the whole thing was just the right proportions.  

I also got a few drinks: the Finder’s Keeper cocktail, a glass of Pinot Blanco and a Hawksmoor Irish Coffee after dessert.  All really well made — definitely would recommend the Irish coffee, it was perfect balance of sweet and espresso. 

For dessert I got the coconut passion fruit pavlova, which was an ideal balance to my starchy meal.  I’m not really into chocolate or toffee pudding and this was the only lighter/fruity dessert.  I had to stop myself from licking the plate. 

Service was fantastic — the bartenders were so helpful and major shout out to Katie for such excellent service.  

Definitely looking forward to coming back again and trying other menu items.  Great atmosphere — not too loud and comfortable seating.

Opinion was divided across our table, though, so your perception of the food will depend on your palate and what appeals to you personally. Although I didn't love everything I ate, I still really appreciated the chefs' creativity and fearlessness when it came to bold flavors, interesting textures, and unusual combinations. The portions were on the smaller side, so if you have a big appetite, you might walk away hungry. I left decently full, but I would've liked larger plates to be able to explore the dishes better - there were so many interesting components, but many were in such small quantities that I couldn't mix and match and assemble multiple bites with them. Finally, many of the dishes are eaten with your hands rather than utensils, so if that bothers you, plan accordingly.

**Drinks - N/A.** The restaurant is BYOB. We went overboard with drinks so our table ended up overcrowded with bottles, but that's our fault. They offered us a complimentary round of shots (whiskey or tea) at the end of the meal, which was a pleasant surprise.

**Service - 7.5.** You're on your own for the most part as the servers are also the chefs busy preparing your meal. As such, the pacing was a little inconsistent, sometimes rather fast and occasionally a bit slow, but not too noticeable if you're with good company. The introductions to each course were impressively descriptive, and the chefs were happy to answer questions and offer suggestions on the best way to approach each dish. (Lastly, although I'm not factoring it into my rating since these interactions took place outside of our dining experience, I think this still deserves acknowledgement and appreciation: the restaurant was very helpful and quick to respond when I reached out about scheduling, dietary restrictions, and recommendations for beverage pairings.)

**Ambiance - 6.** This is a no-frills, unpretentious dining experience. It's dark and can get quite loud between the upbeat music and conversation of nearby guests. I wouldn't recommend visiting as a solo diner or a party that prefers formality, but it was a great atmosphere for a casual social outing. I'd say the vibe leans much more towards a bustling bar than pompous fine dining.

**Note:** The bill includes a 20% service charge (covering gratuity) which is disclosed upfront when making the reservation. You don't receive any sort of bill at the restaurant.

**Would I go again?** Yes, I want to support restaurants that aren't afraid to innovate. I'd come back with friends if they introduced enough new dishes.

1gyvwqu,ChicagoFood,Komal Chef Counter at Carnivale,"Surprise of the year for me was the Komal Chef Counter at Carnivale. To be completely honest, it’s probably been 15 years since I’ve last eaten here - I had always thought of Carnivale as a festive tourist attraction or special occasion restaurant for suburbanites. Recently heard about Chef Carlos Garza turning their old seafood counter in the back into a chef counter experience with a traditional kamal and curiosity got the best of me. I’m glad it did. This is a chef who deeply cares about what he’s doing - where he’s sourcing ingredients, the personal story for each dish, etc. He’s cultivating his own garden on the roof and could talk endlessly about food, from his love affair with their black garlic to his fermented yucca sauce. From my experience, this is always the secret ingredient in food - neon palm trees and Carnivale theatrics aside. The pacing of the meal was very well executed, the general arc of the dishes made sense, and there were some real standouts that completely blew me away (such as the first picture here, the iberico pork with collard greens, rice, fried banana; the hamachi crudo with chicharron and fermented yucca sauce; the churrasco steak, braised short rib, and vegetables cooked on the Komal, served on a plate screen-printed with black garlic. The price for this is $149/person which I found completely reasonable for the amount of food and quality of ingredients (I was already full going into the 8th course, so I’m glad desserts were on the lighter side). Things I’d nitpick: the yucca chips for a couple of the dishes weren’t perfectly crunchy, the katafi wrapping on the coconut shrimp could’ve been slightly thinner, the desserts could’ve been slightly less alcohol-forward (the pineapples in rum syrup were pretty overpowering for someone who doesn’t drink - but this is a personal preference).

1gmaiak,ChicagoFood,Omakase Yume x Bonyeon: Counter Culture (November 2024).,"I went to the limited-time collaboration between Omakase Yume and Bonyeon for a 17-course tasting menu intended to showcase the best of both omakase experiences. **8/10 overall.**

Please note that I attended the first service on the opening night of this brand new event, so they have likely already learned from this experience and will improve going forward. The event lasts until November 10, so you still have a chance to snag a seat.

**Food - 8.** Most of the dishes presented were highlights from each restaurant's menu and therefore were obviously wonderful. The menu delivered Korean-inspired dishes with a wide variety of flavors, textures, and techniques which kept the meal fresh and interesting (no small feat for 17 courses). Several new dishes were added just for this collaboration, however, and could use some refinement in my opinion. The flavors were still delicious for the most part, but small, easily-remedied details like awkward tableware or odd presentation detracted from some dishes or occasionally made them challenging to consume. Another thing which needs to be addressed is consistency in steak preparation - those courses were prepared tableside by three different chefs, and I observed noticeable differences in the cook on the meat, plating, and subsequent timing with which they were delivered to guests. Again, these were relatively minor issues, but resolving them will significantly elevate the entire experience.

**Drinks - N/A.** I ordered the yuzu kukicha tea and it was pleasant. The staff kept topping me up so I probably drank an entire teapot or two over the course of the night.

**Service - 8.** Perhaps because it was their very first combined service, the staff and chefs seemed a bit nervous. The staff were prompt and attentive throughout the meal, but the closely-spaced counter seating made it difficult at times for them to provide unobtrusive service. The food was prepared and presented by several chefs, who appeared to have differing comfort levels with formally describing the dishes. I would've liked to hear more about some courses since the menu was not shared upfront. The chef serving my particular section of the counter was clearly knowledgeable and passionate about his job, but just seemed to prefer answering questions and sharing details spontaneously. The pacing and serving of courses was a little off until the chefs found their rhythm. I expect that will improve as the event progresses.

**Ambiance - 8.** I enjoyed the overall ambiance of the restaurant (Bonyeon), which balances a dark and moody interior with a brightly-lit counter to create an intimate atmosphere. The restaurant was sensibly designed to put its steak omakase front and center, with grills built directly into the counter. I enjoyed watching the chefs create those courses, but felt somewhat disappointed that I couldn't really see the other preparations happening deeper in the open kitchen. That was one of my favorite aspects of my prior visit to Omakase Yume. The vibe of this dinner was much livelier than my meal at Omakase Yume, with guests chatting freely with one another while the chefs focused on their work. I haven't been to Bonyeon on its own, so I'm not sure how this experience compares.

**Note:** The prepaid reservation does not include an automatic gratuity, but anything purchased at the restaurant comes with a 20% service charge.

**Would I go again?** While I enjoyed my meal, one visit was enough to accomplish my goal of sampling the best of each omakase. I probably wouldn't come back unless the menu changed significantly so I could try new dishes. I will wait to visit Bonyeon until I feel they've settled in and are more consistent.

1h029nz,ChicagoFood,Review – Give Feld a Star (Or Two!),"TLDR: I went to Feld for the first time on Saturday and had a phenomenal meal. Service, setting, concept, and flavors all knocked it out of the park. I have followed the criticism on Reddit and elsewhere—it may or may not have been warranted in the early days of the restaurant, but growing pains or no, this is a serious contender with the other tasting menus in Chicago and now one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. 

 

**Most Importantly: The Food** 

I read a lot of the ***positive*** reviews of Feld, and they all seemed to say the same things (it is so thoughtful, interesting, great concept, sourcing/ingredients, service, etc.), and also *omit* the same things: that the food actually tastes good. With so many of the good reviews dancing around the question, and as someone who cares way more about flavor than any other elements of the fine dining experience, I went in with low expectations. I honestly went to witness a train wreck, but instead got a magic show--everything tasted ***amazing***. It may be that it matched my palate well (I generally enjoy hot, salty, intense, etc.), but even the types of dishes I am not usually keen on were great. I loved the length of the menu and experience, and hope they stick with this course-overload approach because it is hard to find now. Going through the pictures in order: 

 

1. The duck broth came right when we each sat down. It was a perfect temperature for coming in from the cold (just under too hot to take a hearty sip—excellent and very cozy) and was salty and rich.
2. Chicken liver potato tartlet. Liver forward, which I like, but all the other flavors came through in the end. Very good.  Tempura enoki (I forgot to take the pic before I ruined the sauces). Tasty fried mushroom with some sauces. Good but nothing new or wonderful. 
3. Mushroom crostini. Amazing flavors coming from the cracker and the paste underneath the mushrooms, which were also so delicious. Salty, grain-y, umami. Loved this. Nice plate too (all the tableware was beautiful). 
4. Beets with horseradish sauce. Interesting and very tasty. 
5. Build your own lobster roll. Each piece was excellent on its own and amazing when assembled. I loved the garlic butter sauce. Nice story about the sourcing from Maine too. 
6. Turnip in ginger broth. I suppose this was a very good turnip but I don’t particularly care about turnips. The broth was so good so I would take a bite of the turnip and soak it again in the broth. Nice middle course. 
7. Komatsuna. Nice broth again—clearly a strength of the chef. Very tasty all mixed up, even if this is the kind of thing I would care less about in anticipation of more proteins. 
8. Rye and apple pancake. Super flavorful and complex, fresh fruit plus toasty, hearty grain, felt very autumn, awesome little bite and went very well with the champagne.
9. Sweet potato and pear. One of my favorite things I ate all year. Just incredibly potato-y, cooked beautifully, and the sauce was insane. 
   1. Some review earlier said nothing was seasoned? Maybe then, but not now. This might be too salty for some but perfect for me. 
10. Cauliflower picked egg yolk. Another incredible dish. The menu is building beautifully at this point and I am getting overwhelmed by how good each new thing is. This was very salty and sharp/bitter with the perfectly-cooked cauliflower plus fatty and rich with the egg yolk and sauce—powerful and balanced. Banger. 
11. Lobster tail. I started with just a bite of the lobster and was surprised (and initially a little off put) by how lightly it was cooked. It was almost raw and reminded me of another purposefully undercooked lobster I had at Table by Bruno Verjus. I didn’t love that first bite initially, on its own, but for the next bite I combined the lobster with the sauce, the vegetable, and the herby dumpling thing and was blown away. I ended up liking it more than the Table raw lobster! (Recency bias may play a role in this comparison, but they were so on par with each other. Worth keeping in mind that Table is another restaurant that gets a lot of flack but I loved.) 
12. Mushroom soup. Excellent again. No detailed notes on this one—just so many good dishes I can’t keep up with thinking about them.
13. Foie gras. The foie was amazing—a hearty amount, with great charred onions and sauce. Incredible flavor. I don’t love the mouthfeel of too much foie without something firmer or fibrous to chew on, so I could have used a bit more of those little onions or something else, but still this was incredible foie. It is also refreshing to have a truly savory foie—it is so often paired with something fruity and sweet, which I also like of course but is a bit too easy/common. The story about the sourcing was also nice—the farmer raises very few birds and takes good care of them, and this comes through in the taste of the product. 
14. Duck (same bird!). Simply put, wonderfully cooked high quality bird with great sauce. I don’t care about bok choy but this was a nice addition. 
15. Cheese. Hot cheese melted over ice cream. Awesome transition to dessert. Such amazing cheese and a great way to serve it mixing temperatures and savory/lightly sweet. Loved it. 
16. As a side note, I saw so much criticism of one of the past cheese courses, with the naysayers complaining about the presentation. I’m sorry, it’s a cheese course—how else have you seen cheese courses other than cheese on a plate? I am sure there are other presentations and approaches (such as the cheese over ice cream from Saturday!), but go to a \*\*\* in Paris and at some point they will give you a couple pieces of cheese on a plate. The sourcing, story, and flavor matter more than your ideas about how it looked. 
17. Quince and cider dessert. At this point I am quite drunk (had a couple before dinner too) and don’t have much to say about this one other than at the time I thought it fucking rocked yet again. 
18. Plum pit rosemary dessert. Great cake, mixed so well with the other elements. Awesome.
19. Chocolate. So good. Took a bite before the pic. Another nice sourcing story—you are tasting things you would not otherwise have access to, and it does add a lot to the experience for me. 
20. Petit fours. Each so tasty and a great way to end. (Photos combined because of picture limit)
21. More alcohol! (Not pictured) They offered a very interesting selection of post-dinner spirits. I really like the cadence—not trying to turn the table and get me out, very communal, hang-out, wind the evening down atmosphere. At this point I am quite full and it’s great to sit and savor it all a bit longer than in the usual tasing menu experience. And we aren’t even done!
22. Smores. The communal aspect of the dinner came together at the end as we were invited out to make smores at the fire. I chatted with the chef and the other diners and hung out for quite a while. Another very nice idea and something you wouldn’t get elsewhere. 
23. Menu.

**Wine** 

I did the wine paring. Good value for the wines you are getting, all good and thoughtful pairing choices, and nice explanations for each. I am much more food-focused but recommend the pairing.  

  

**Service**

The service was on par with the two-star and three-star restaurants I have been to. Very attentive and personable. 

Also note that when the server offered mer the welcome champagne for while we waited to get started he made it clear that this would be a supplement—so that seems like a positive adjustment, perhaps in response to fair criticism here. 

 

**Setting**  

A beautiful space, it feels communal since everyone is facing the center of the room, but spread out enough to still be intimate/private. They played good music, the bathrooms are very nice, everything smells good, etc. I also quite like the entryway and being greeted by the whole team as you enter. 

**Criticism** 

A few minor points here: The som called me earlier in the day to confirm my reservation and asked that I show up promptly at 6:50 for my 7:00 p.m. reservation. What is the point of this? There is only one seating a night! Just tell people to show up promptly at 7, the time of the reservation! It makes no difference and just adds confusion (for some! I was there at 6:50).

As you'll see they used the same green leaf in two of the different dishes. Man, I don't give a shit about that green leaf. It was fine I suppose, and but having it repeated on the menu, AND basically be the same as the bok choy (imo--my palate is not refined on these matters) was like ok fine I'll eat this again. Makes sense from a sourcing standpoint and didn't detract from the great dishes overall, so this is a very minor gripe and one particular to people like me.

The restaurant is a little bit on the bright inside. Ideally the center islands would be illuminated, as well as the food you are eating on the table, and the rest of the room a bit darker. Maybe this isn't practical, but they should check out the approaches to lighting at Oriole and Atomix. So bright it kinda felt like a cooking show or cooking class, and I imagine takes a bit away from the intimacy with ones own group. However, this could be intentional, since everyone faces the center islands anyway so it is more about that experience than being with/talking to/facing the people you are with. Another small note, not a big deal.

**Final Notes** 

I think that Feld deserves at least one star, and maybe even two, or is well on the way to the second. For comparison purposes, in October I dined at Atomix, Eleven Madison Park, and Le Bernadin (and a handful of great 1\*s in NYC in the same trip), and recently went to Alinea Group’s Next (Charlie Trotter) and FIRE. To me, this was either on par with or better than all of them. Does it seem a bit much to say Feld is as good as Atomix? Perhaps, yea. Feld has the advantages of recency bias and the fact that I walked into Atomix with 2 lbs of Katz pastrami in me (poor decision making on my part, that day) and instead went to Feld hungry. But even accounting for these I actually liked the food and overall experience at Feld just as much! Very comparable, at least. So, I loved it. Go try for yourself and let me know if you disagree!

Final pic in comments",2,0.52,27.0,2024-11-25 21:24:46,dancing,,,,"Review – Give Feld a Star (Or Two!) TLDR: I went to Feld for the first time on Saturday and had a phenomenal meal. Service, setting, concept, and flavors all knocked it out of the park. I have followed the criticism on Reddit and elsewhere—it may or may not have been warranted in the early days of the restaurant, but growing pains or no, this is a serious contender with the other tasting menus in Chicago and now one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. 

 

**Most Importantly: The Food** 

I read a lot of the ***positive*** reviews of Feld, and they all seemed to say the same things (it is so thoughtful, interesting, great concept, sourcing/ingredients, service, etc.), and also *omit* the same things: that the food actually tastes good. With so many of the good reviews dancing around the question, and as someone who cares way more about flavor than any other elements of the fine dining experience, I went in with low expectations. I honestly went to witness a train wreck, but instead got a magic show--everything tasted ***amazing***. It may be that it matched my palate well (I generally enjoy hot, salty, intense, etc.), but even the types of dishes I am not usually keen on were great. I loved the length of the menu and experience, and hope they stick with this course-overload approach because it is hard to find now. Going through the pictures in order: 

 

1. The duck broth came right when we each sat down. It was a perfect temperature for coming in from the cold (just under too hot to take a hearty sip—excellent and very cozy) and was salty and rich.
2. Chicken liver potato tartlet. Liver forward, which I like, but all the other flavors came through in the end. Very good.  Tempura enoki (I forgot to take the pic before I ruined the sauces). Tasty fried mushroom with some sauces. Good but nothing new or wonderful. 
3. Mushroom crostini. Amazing flavors coming from the cracker and the paste underneath the mushrooms, which were also so delicious. Salty, grain-y, umami. Loved this. Nice plate too (all the tableware was beautiful). 
4. Beets with horseradish sauce. Interesting and very tasty. 
5. Build your own lobster roll. Each piece was excellent on its own and amazing when assembled. I loved the garlic butter sauce. Nice story about the sourcing from Maine too. 
6. Turnip in ginger broth. I suppose this was a very good turnip but I don’t particularly care about turnips. The broth was so good so I would take a bite of the turnip and soak it again in the broth. Nice middle course. 
7. Komatsuna. Nice broth again—clearly a strength of the chef. Very tasty all mixed up, even if this is the kind of thing I would care less about in anticipation of more proteins.

lcqnh09,1e0xyrh,omfgcows,I sure hope this goes well but it doesn't usually. The more obvious thing for everyone that doesn't work a traditional job structure is hoping it stays a 24 hour gym. To this day. That's why I've been a member at xsport fitness for like 7 years now. Their facilities might not be the best and their equipment outdated but it sure is open when I have time to get a workout in at 2:00 a.m. or something.,27,2024-07-11 16:38:35

kv2c0m9,1bbd8ck,kreplachkid,"Hey Everyone!

Want to provide an update (along with an observation and lesson learned) for the six to eight people who might potentially give a shit.  

First, thank you everyone for your suggestions.  While Chicago goes hard on pastries and delightful breakfast options, I feel like there is a big gap in the good ol fashioned bakery department.  Being familiar and a fan of Spinning J and Loaf Lounge, I started there.  Both were very similar, the retail seems to exist to support surplus from the restaurant, and it was a roll of the dice if they could accommodate from a timing and quantity perspective (please note this is NOT a complaint, it doesn't fit their business model and that makes sense).  I then saw pictures of those sourdough muffins at Au Levain and thought that needed to be my next target, until I saw a Sunday pickup only (needed them for Saturday).  Next I tried calling Reno.  After ringing a few times got a voice recording letting me know the phones are not working and to email someone.  I emailed them with no response.

This finally takes me to my lesson learned:  when you crowd source a request to Reddit and there is a top up voted comment, you listen.  Admittedly, my snobby Chicago bias prevented me from going straight to Santa Monica Summer House.  A California name!?  A chain with locations outside of Chicago!?  Couldn't be me.  Well, finally I checked them out and arrived to find piles of delicious, homemade English muffins.

Thanks again everyone for the help, it was a journey.",2,2024-03-15 18:07:41

Also if you wanted to do it up for the evening, the the restaurant is located within the Palmerhouse hotel which also houses The Magic Parlor. A cocktail hour where cocktail attire is suggested but not mandated. You can couple dinner then a magic show. dinner is all inclusive in which they provide the magic menu for you to choose from. It’s bevrages, an appetizer, an entre, and desert for 41$ once tacked on to the magic parkour price of 79$. It comes out to 120$ total. It’s entirely worth it and drinks during the magic show are free. At 79$ that’s usually the price of about 7 cocktails/glasses of wine/bubbly. Get sauced during the show and you’ve come out ahead! I’ve gone twice, it’s great!!! Everything, the magic, the food the atmosphere etc. you can’t go wrong.

lcqnh09,1e0xyrh,omfgcows,I sure hope this goes well but it doesn't usually. The more obvious thing for everyone that doesn't work a traditional job structure is hoping it stays a 24 hour gym. To this day. That's why I've been a member at xsport fitness for like 7 years now. Their facilities might not be the best and their equipment outdated but it sure is open when I have time to get a workout in at 2:00 a.m. or something.,24,2024-07-11 16:38:35

&#x200B;

* I love the mornings after it snows overnight in my neighborhood because everyone is out there together shoveling and it really feels like a community moment. The middle aged dads on my block take turns shoveling for our elderly and disabled neighbors. Everyone greets everyone else and chats while hard at work shoveling together. Usually someone comes out and shovels out a bunch of our street because the city doesn't come by and do it for hours.
* I love the huge old trees in the parkways on residential streets, in the parks and boulevards with their colored leaves in the fall and the green they add to the neighborhood all summer.
* I love that we live in a city but it is still easy to get out and see some nature.
* I love all the live music events outdoors all summer long, even when I don't go to them, there's something about just walking by and hearing folks make music.
* I love the Chicago park district and the many awesome classes they offer across the city in arts, music, sports and more for surprisingly affordable prices.
* I love the Chicago public library and their many, many, many cool events, amazing resources and awesome buildings.
* I grew up at the various Chicago museums, and love all the things they exposed me to outside of my bubble through the wonderful work they do.
* I love that we have free conservatories and a free zoo that you can visit.

When I lived on the east coast for a few years while I was in school, I missed home so much in a lot of ways that I didn't anticipate. The freedom to walk, bike and public transit to most of the places I wanted to go was something that I never really appreciated until I lived in a place where you'd have to drive to go anywhere. I also missed the linguistic diversity that you experience everywhere here on the streets, in the shops and in your community.

Cabrini-Green was Gold Coast adjacent ... one of the most well known housing projects in the country next to one of richest neighborhoods in the city.  Some would even argue that changing state of being this would be the core reason for our public housing ""reform"" by shifting from controlled mid and high rise housing in favor of vouchers under the policy of getting people into neighborhoods instead to improve their access to economic opportunity. 

I do not know if any studies were ever done to see if that assumption was correct.

However, while many at the time criticized this as a land grab by rich developers, that never really caught on.  Not really sure why.  Some might theorize that trying to develop the land the was once known by the name of a housing project might be a tough sell, so instead of expanded Gold Coast we got vacant.

Demolition was completed in 2011; that was *after* the last real estate crash, so it's not like the economics to expand into it aren't there.",35,2024-08-15 23:20:14

 Just captures a certain time and place for me. Open late. Cheap but not boring food. Video store / rental place downstairs. Eclectic, overstuffed decor like a circus from hell - defiantly different from the minimalist industrial loft look that was becoming popular even then. Big booths where you could bring in a book or a copy of the Reader and just chill for a while without staff or other patrons giving you the stink eye.


 Nothing special at all, but it just captures the feeling of ""what Chicago restaurants used to be"" for me, in a way I really miss.

lngljpa,1fi9otz,zethenus,"This kinda brings up what might be a fairly unique situation. 

There’s a bus stop that I pass by several times a week. At certain times during the day, there’s a bus that just sits on the bus stop with hazards on. 

This creates an issue because the bus on this route put the hazards on when stopping to pick up/drop off passengers. 

Just by the hazards alone, one can’t really tell if the bus is sitting or is picking up/dropping off passenger.  The driver just sits there chatting on walkie or phone, not sure which. Or alight the bus and stand around a bit. Or sits back with his/her eyes close. They aren’t really doing something specific. 

Thus there is usually a line forming behind the bus when this happens as drivers correctly assumes the bus will mover after a few minutes and this confusion creates a traffic congestion. The longest I’ve been  stuck behind the bus sitting at this intersection is 15mins +/-

Thus the question is, at this point, should one make a right turn in front of the bus?

P.S. at some point drivers start making a right in front of the bus, including me. The danger was at one of these attempted right turn, the bus just moved right as I was about the make the right. Since it’s now in motion, I have no choice by to go straight and take a long detour to my destination.",1,2024-09-16 14:57:34

Bobby Love's: karaoke bar, bring your A game


Jackhammer: at the site of them former Chicago Eagle, has an attached leather/sex shop, had a truly wild cruising basement, everyone's waiting for them to open after renovations that look to make the place just transcendently great, has a 4am license

Roscoes - 20's bar that does a lot of drag themed events (Rupaul) and has many different theme nights with decent beer deals and food on Sundays

j0wuocx,zpdcor,zap283,"That's a valid choice! I will push back very gently about the consent thing. It's not that bathhouses don't run on consent, it's that the rules are different. By entering the space, one consents to exploratory touching and to seeing others engage in their chosen activities. It's a space in which reaching out is always encouraged, but saying no is always respected. Because these rules are explicitly built into the space, it's still a far cry from the vagueness of everywhere else- entrants know they're signing up to be touched and that they must check the other's response each time they escalate. 

So, bathhouses and other cruising spaces are not places that don't respect boundaries, but rather places with blanket consent to certain things and socially codified ways of expressing interest, disinterest, consent, and nonconsent. That said, for everyone who is uncomfortable with even getting close to their boundaries, cruising spaces are probably a bad fit.  

Summary:

The culture overall: everyone assumes everyone shares the same boundaries they hold and feels awkward correcting others

Ethical sex culture: boundaries are discussed in advance and during sex

Cruising culture: boundaries are communicated as they become relevant, boundary assertion is expected and respected",5,2022-12-19 18:31:24

Anyway, there is a reason for this shape but it isn't so republicans or democrats can get more votes. Sometime around 1991 a judge ruled that hispanics in Illinois warranted a minority-majority district in congress. This is in keeping with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. (I'm not a fan of this rule myself because it tends to hurt democrats severely in states like North Carolina and Alabama, which means it may give minorities *less* voting power in contradiction to the intention of the law).

You have Puerto Ricans in Humboldt Park/Hermosa, about half what is needed to make a minority-majority district. You have Mexicans in Little Village/Pilsen, also about half what is needed to make a minority-majority district. These are the only places in the state where you could make such a district. Why not connect directly? District 7 is in the way, and it is a black-designated minority-majority district. To keep both contiguous, the connection either has to run *way* to the west (like it does) or *way* to the east through Grant Park. It goes West because the West side/west suburbs aren't enough population for a district on their own. The district picks up more population around Washington Park to fill itself out.",306,2016-08-27 08:46:44

It’s not fair!“ But then, when you point out things like the electoral college, and the Senate, that’s totally fair, because apparently it helps keep things “balanced.“

And I don’t think this would go down the way they think. If they did spin Cook County off into its own state, that would just create two additional Democratic senators and a bunch of new electoral college votes, which I’m sure they don’t want. And it would instantly make the rest of the state poor as fuck.

We are heartbroken to share that a festival attendee passed away yesterday. Our deepest condolences go out to his family, friends, and loved ones during this incredibly challenging time.

The health, safety, and well-being of our fans and community have always been our top priority. We are aware of the various speculations surrounding this tragedy, including claims that it may be linked to the Slayer crowd. However, we want to clarify that this is not the case. The on-site medical team responded to this medical incident, near the Ferris Wheel area, prior to Slayer's performance. Out of respect for the family's privacy, we wlill not be sharing further details.

Riot Fest to provide sufficient light, shade or other shelter from the elements, anywhere near enough water for the size of the crowd and the temperatures the air can hit on those days, just the name a few of the very basic safety measures the organizer of the show is ethically obligated to provide. That seems to be because they use access to those basics as selling points for their various upgraded tiers.

I can see how random places didn't know the relish involved dye and threw jalapeños on instead to satisfy their preference for fire food and also add the color green.

k573jny,179jabz,damp_circus,"I went to the Avalon Regal Theater and absolutely loved it. Best part was, while I was in there, I met a woman (black woman, for the record) who had gone to shows there over years and was able to tell me about what that was like, she also remembered the previous incarnation of the Regal theater that was by 47th, seeing all kinds of famous acts come through there too as a kid.

She didn't know about Open House Chicago, but lived in the neighborhood and was doing some errands and happened to notice that the place was open (which it usually isn't) and stopped in. But she totally could have been a proper docent!

And hell yeah seconding your feelings about the place. It's just gorgeous inside and has actual art pieces all over.

In ""old buildings"" vein I also enjoyed the Fine Arts Building across from Grant Park. Just beautiful restoration throughout, also interesting seeing how many women's organizations have had offices in there over years. In some of the far corners of the building you can see a few forgotten halls that had wonky carpet, drab brown paint and horrible drop ceilings, kinda makes you really appreciate the restoration of the main part of it haha. 

I went to both ""blank open floors"" buildings, the 19th floor of Big Red (now ""SHVO"" as the elevator operator was certain to mention many times, made me wonder if she's required to do that...) and the 44th floor of BMO tower.

We should be able to do all of it, we just need to organize around better use of our tax funds (read: root out corruption, wasteful spending) and work to regulate the issues that are making the city unlivable for the rest of us (traffic enforcement, deteriorating infrastructure, stymied wages, skyrocketing housing costs).",1,2024-07-22 16:49:01

Tickets aren't too expensive and there is no drink minimum This is where a lot of great comedic actors get their start (think Tina Fey, Steve Carrell, Bill Murray, etc...) and hone their craft. It's also in Old Town which is a cool neighborhood with lots of great restaurants.",3,2023-10-10 13:34:07
k4ehmf4,174a40y,None,"Dang, you sure can put away the food and drinks. Quite impressive! This was a packed itinerary and sounds like you had a blast. Assuming you come back (please do), these are the 5 things I'd suggest you add to your to-do list:

1. Rent bikes and take a ride along the lakefront path. Big fan of stopping for a hot dog and brewski  along the way at The Clocktower Cafe (off in the distance behind the tennis courts at Recreation Drive)

2. Go to Portillo's for a beef and cheddar croissant and a cake shake. Cake shakes are made with mayonnaise (not kidding) and are disgusting when you think about what's in 'em, but they are AMAZING. The best shake ever with chunks of chocolate cake floating in it. Get you some. 

3. Hit up Spacca Napoli in Ravenswood for delicious thin crust pizza. Mmmm. Pretty sure they were just voted one of the best restaurants in the world. Maybe country. It's damn good. 

4. Go to The Weiner Circle, late. I've lived here for almost 25 years and still haven't made it to this place, but it's an iconic Chicago staple that apparently needs to be experienced. Ask for a chocolate shake. It probably won't taste as good as Portillo's, but it will be entertaining. 

5. See a show at The Chicago Theater. Breathtakingly beautiful place, great acoustics.

Editing to add: world, not country. Highly recommend the burrata, too. 🍕

k4c2sz7,174a40y,coldham55,"Thanks! I really felt like I didn't stray far enough from that downtown, Lincoln Park, Wrigleyville area but we were knocking out a lot of the landmark stuff. Next time we can chill out on all of that and really dive into the neighborhoods. I am fascinated with anywhere that has a proper mass transit system and really enjoy navigating cities that way.",5,2023-10-10 16:55:57

k4c3al9,174a40y,coldham55,"Yep I just happened to come across an article earlier that morning that it had opened so we made it there about 30 minutes before closing and were able to get a drink. Was cool, had to solve a little clue to make it into the bar. I really enjoyed that area and the DePaul campus was beautiful",1,2023-10-10 16:59:07
k4c4kmo,174a40y,coldham55,"That place blew me away! When we sat down I didn't automatically notice how many bottles were behind the bar because they are stacked 5 deep, not until he slammed that heavy book of a menu down. The bartender was great to talk to and he was super knowledgeable about his inventory and really enjoyed talking about it. He even showed me a bottle that was bottled during prohibition! $200/oz. I opted out of that tasting",3,2023-10-10 17:07:31
k4c3llf,174a40y,coldham55,Yeah we had a damn good time! I made a point to record everything we did this time as so many other trips I forget the small details quickly after getting back to the grind. Plus it was really enjoyable to do. I think my wife rolled her eyes a couple of times but all in fun,1,2023-10-10 17:01:05

k4c43z3,174a40y,coldham55,Yep for sure that is what I am thinking. Since we knocked out so many of the landmark things this trip next time we can chill a whole lot more. I was ok with the weather and actually wished a bit cooler to be honest. It was such a inhumanely brutally hot summer down here in Texas I wanted as far from the heat as I could get for a bit.,1,2023-10-10 17:04:26
k4c73se,174a40y,coldham55,Yep that is probably my biggest regret is not hitting a comedy show so it will be top of the list for next trip! We walked past Second City and Zanies during the day but timing just didn't work out this time. We are actually about to see Tina Fey and Amy Poehler in Austin this Saturday,3,2023-10-10 17:24:22

k4c3s3l,174a40y,coldham55,Yeah about that... Haha I think I have had 2 beers since I have been back in 10 days. Probably lay low for the rest of the month at least. It was definitely not hard to find a beer up there.,1,2023-10-10 17:02:14

k4c5z6j,174a40y,coldham55,Haha we definitively went hard in the paint this trip. We had my parents watching our 2.5 yr old so I think we were really wanting to live it up like we were in our 20's again for a little while.,3,2023-10-10 17:16:51

k4c6874,174a40y,coldham55,Yep! My wife found that and it was actually the first thing we planned about a month before we left. Bavettes I was exactly 21 days out at 9AM on their website to grab a reservation as so many mentioned here on this sub. We did a 4:45pm dinner so I had no issues getting in. Was a really cool spot and good food,2,2023-10-10 17:18:31
k4c6i9z,174a40y,coldham55,We walked a ton and then used the CTA system (Trains and Busses) We go the Ventra card and loaded a 7 day pass for the each of us ($20 each) That covered 90% of our navigation of the city. We took 2-3 Lyfts when the timing made sense but really tried to avoid that at all costs to really get into the life of a Chicagoan and avoid being on the roads,4,2023-10-10 17:20:23
k4c6lu6,174a40y,coldham55,We didn't before we came but thanks to that niceness of everyone we met we do now!,4,2023-10-10 17:21:02

k4c59gz,174a40y,coldham55,"Sold! I honestly have most of it to thank to this sub for my Ideas! What I like to do is go on Google Maps and just star anything that sounds cool. Then we plan in stone the things that we for sure want to do and need tickets/RSVPs. Then as we navigate the city I can look on my map and be like hey there is this cool bar I read about 2 blocks over, lets go have a drink. I had about 190 things tagged on my list so didn't even scratch the surface. Plus we went to plenty of things that weren't even tagged",3,2023-10-10 17:12:03

k4c5ihl,174a40y,coldham55,Yeah we were just not really in the mood for a crowd that evening and thought we wouldn't be bringing the right energy to the party anyway so although I regret not getting by there I think it was the best call for the moment. We will come back and make sure to hit a show there early on in the trip while the tanks are still full,1,2023-10-10 17:13:44
k4c5nc6,174a40y,coldham55,Yes we absolutely loved that place the first night and already declared that we were coming back for the Pizza before the trip was over. Meat Lovers is exactly what we had,1,2023-10-10 17:14:38

You catch up on Netflix, read, work on hobbies, power up and plan for when the weather gets better. It does get old by March, but it’s a nice change of pace. Summers, in contrast, are the exact opposite.

The best way to get through it is to invest in warm boots (think Sorels with wool inserts) and a good long coat (opt for down, most coats on the market won’t do). Hat, gloves, and scarves are a given. As someone who’s lived here her entire life and has suffered through many winters, I was shocked when I realized just how much more bearable the winter is when you you are warm and your feet are dry.",25,2022-10-15 09:29:49

 4 3-6 months is her estimate guess. On how long, this slow change will take.",1,2024-07-16 12:14:23
ldmv8v6,1e0xyrh,Hediak-Chigashi,"I have 19 sessions left with them. I had ankle surgery and can no longer walk for the foreseeable future. I go to the physical location on Elston, they say call LA fitness. I call LA fitness, they say they can’t refund as I didn’t give them any more. That I gave Xsports. The customer service reps are all very defensive and rude on the phone when I talk about cancellation. I don’t know if that’s company policy.

Sixteen years later I saw them again at the Metro, and waited in the receiving line to thank him. I kept dancing guys. I lost 60 pounds dancing to their music and kept it off. I showed him a picture.

**Quimby's** Quimby's caters to comic and zine fans, and carries mainly small-press art/culture hardcovers. B&N doesn't really do any of those things. 

**Myopic** is all used, the kind of place that sells rare first edition Aleister Crowley texts and esoteric philosophy pamphlets, and has an incredible selection of out-of-print hardcovers and paperbacks in every possible genre. B&N doesn't tread those waters.

B&N **might** have an impact on a relative newcomer to the area, **Volumes Bookcafe,** but again, Volumes provides a coffee shop/cafe/salon experience, with a steady lineup of talks from authors, workshops, etc. Volumes and B&N sell the same kinds of books, so there might be some impact there, but B&N doesn't provide the social component that Volumes does.

The market niche for bookstores is closer to clothes shopping, where you know kind of what you want but not specifically and you really just want to browse and try things.

The IRS allows me to make two queries every 30 days, and they’re consistently being ignored. 

WLCO’s BOD listing is way out of date, beginning with their President — the daughter of a high ranking Illinois GOP Trump Organizer (shares the same politics) that has skated this NFP dangerously close to being political. 

Many of WLCO’s Board Members jumped ship after WLCO was busted for selling tickets to a free event — Taste of Randolph — held in the Public Way:

https://chicago.eater.com/2023/7/11/23791144/taste-of-randolph-entrance-fee-suggested-donations-west-loop-community-organization-caught

WLCO then misappropriated the $80,000+ in Taste of Randolph funds originally raised for a Children’s Charity (Face the Future), handing out “microgrants” to their friends and allies instead:

https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/08/28/west-loop-street-festival-used-charitys-name-to-raise-money-but-nonprofit-says-it-was-misleading/

WLCO’s Taste of Randolph represents the biggest Festival circuit offenders — and are a good place to start a reform effort. 

To that end I launched a Claim Form and am collecting Taste of Randolph Refund Requests, here, as promised by Star Events CEO:

https://forms.gle/61f4zz82hYSHD5qu7

Keep them coming reddit!

While everyone points fingers at Star Events, I’ve learned they follow their Clients’ lead. 

If an Unelected Neighborhood Group like WLCO demands a large guaranteed payout (eg $80,000+ for WLCO), then up go the cattle chutes and aggressive gate staff that we all hate.

If the Client is chill like the West Central Association’s Art Fest, with less than a $10k payout, then Star Events is equally chill and the gates are open with no admission fee — much more enjoyable. 

Understanding that economic dynamic, I’ve been working directly with StarEvents’ CEO to open up Chicago Fests (by any Producer) to the Community at large — including free booth space — while also working towards processing the claims received to date. 

We’ve successfully done this with three West Loop Streetfests to date: West Loop Art Fest (formerly WLCO, changed last minute to WCA), Madison Row Fest (WCA), and Haymarket’s Oktoberfest — changes warmly received by the Community. 

I appreciate your insights into possible courses of action to encourage further reform. I’ve a long history with all of our Unelected Neighborhood Groups, and understand their business models inside and out.

- Start with Haymarket, then hit Publican for snacks and some good beer (they open at 3PM). Walk to Grand Blue Line stop.

- Take Blue Line To Revolution, then hit another place around there - The Radler has good German beers and food, and Cole's is a good place with a decent beer selection as well. The Boiler Room is also good. The Whistler is awesome for cocktails, but hard alcohol can easily derail a long day of drinking. From there get on the Fullerton Bus headed East (or just walk East on Fullerton).

- Hit Quencher's and then get on Western Ave. bus Southbound.

- Get off at Division and Walk East to Small Bar, after that work your way back to Division Blue Line stop.

- Take Blue Line to Grand, hit the Paramount...who the hell am I kidding, just take a cab back to the hotel from Division Street when you can't walk anymore. It will cost about $20.

That is in no way a definitive crawl, but it's got a lot of different types of places on a manageable route. You could also plan something centered around the Red line with places like Goose Island (Clybourn), Atlas, and Hopleaf.

While I can certainly understand why you'd like to go to actual breweries, good beer bars will give you a larger selection of beers to try and usually have some hard to find (or one off) local/regional brews. Hopleaf, Map Room, and Quencher's are the best three in the city, and you should try to fit one of them in.

hh2vqew,qa7x6h,ottonymous,"was lucky enough to watch the sky all season. It was special. I got to see them from limited capacity and no concessions etc and then both sold out finals.

I really ended up emotionally invested in them so I want to share some thoughts as someone who got to see them play all year! Also season tickets and half season tickets are relatively inexpensive and they allow you to bank seats. Find some friends and be entertained. 

 Azura Stevens' play improved so much. I was not a fan of her at the beginning of the season. She was such a weapon in the post season as well as when we assassinated Seattle Storm and Vegas... at the end of the season. So much for the ""separation"" there that commentators praised all year... Swept Storm 3-0 hit Vegas with a 2-1 series that leaves Suns in the top slot... and we had beaten them early in the season. 

Copper was as special in her first minute of the season as she was in the last. Seeing the world finally acknowledge it post season makes me want to cry because it was so deserved. All season she has been a 2k player with cheat codes or something. I legit want to watch some replays at 1/4 speed just to see how in the world she gets all those lay ups despite there being a wall of defenders in the way. My recollection is she was almost always player of the game this season. Candace was a few times I think, Sloot had to have been, Diamond I think was also. 

Dana Evans can sink some deeeeep 3s. I really wanted to see her come in to relieve sloot and immediately drain a 3 in the Finals because I just liked the message I thought it would send.Well,  she drained 3 consecutively in the closing moments of game 3 on Friday. She blew the lid off the place in the last minutes of a blowout game... Getting a crowd that riled up when the game had been over for a quarter and some change? Who does that?! When does that ever happen?! And just to make sure we're all on the same page she's a rookie who grew up in Gary whose job right now is to relieve the best point guard in the league ended that game with such a statement. 

Ruthie Hebert looked amazing in the season. But it looks like they are developing her a little more before she gets into the rotation. But she looks like she is going to be great. Just does everything right, smart, and controlled. Don't sleep on her. Wade also said she's one of his favourites to coach so fingers crossed we'll get to see more of her next season.

Diamond was my favourite player. She had great great great games at the beginning of the season. When she's on she's pretty special to watch, so much heart. I thought her defense in the finals was a big strength for the team and bane for our opponents. Sure she had some bad judgement calls here and there but when she gets all of her skills and abilities clicking-- what a menace. 

Big mama stef Dolson. Sky's 2020 Olympic gold winner for 3x3. When she has the ball in the post it's just great. Moves on moves on moves with the bodyodyody. She's also got sweet dance moves in addition to the post moves. Shes openly queer and representation is nice. 

Lexi Brown. Didn't get to see her too much. But she had a solid performance in the finals. 

Candace Quigley and Sloot. Leaders. I don't know where to start or end on them. City treasures. And Candace being an example for next generations to just go for it. The woman makes millions of dollars in the US with basketball, I doubt any other current player can say that. They go overseas and play for the 6 and 7 figure contracts maybe even 8.

cib6sjw,28i922,noranina,"Hey fellow redditors!

A few years ago, when my friend Eliza and I were in acting school at Illinois State University, we read the play Bachelorette by Leslye Headland and fell in love. We were struck by the honesty of it's characters and their relationships to one another. Specifically, the complex qualities of female friendship. It had everything we loved. Humor, heartbreak, and more than a few badass, strong, complex roles for women. We feel the story that it tells is one that speaks to the modern twenty-something woman, a story that is rarely told with such brutal honesty. 

A couple years later, as roommates in Chicago, we decided that we didn't want to wait any longer to do something we were passionate about. We were tired of waiting around for someone else to provide us with the opportunity we wanted, so we decided to take matters into our own hands. We decided to produce the play ourselves this coming August. We have an incredibly talented cast and amazing team.

Currently, we are trying to raise money for the show. Just in case anyone is interested, here is the link to our indiegogo fundraiser page. I would be so grateful if you would check it out and consider sharing with anyone who you think might be interested!

ldz1iur,1e74439,sydeffex,"My wife and I were able to see an early preview of this show, so my experience may not reflect the final product. But I felt like the director, Joe Mantello, really missed the mark. This review rightly praises Sam Hunter and Laurie Metcalf, and leaves out everything wrong with the production.

Sam Hunter's writing is brilliant. In every one of his plays (and the movie adaptation of The Whale), you get to know these isolated humans who desperately need another human to connect with them. When lifestyle, money, media, politics, religion, sexuality, and even our own physical bodies get in the way of that connection. If you liked LBRR, then you should also go see his other play currently playing in Chicago - ""The Case for the Existence of God"" at Steep.

Laurie Metcalf is great and engaging, but the director only allowed her two tones to speak in; sullen or yelling. Micah Stock adopted this strange affect to his voice that makes him hard to understand or emote with. I literally thought the character was supposed to be autistic (which would have been brilliant, and a very Sam Hunter thing to include). But he just made a bad choice, and the director didn't pull him away from it.

I loved the simplicity of the set design; the feeling of being isolated in a dark black hole was there. But the staging needed one more SOMETHING. Show me stars, show me a void, make the couch sink into the stage, show me a hyper-realistic hospital room in stark contrast to the simplicity of the isolated living room, show me a single point of light in the darkness. I got the isolation, but I didn't get anything else that would deliver a catharsis in contrast to the isolation, so I left the theater with ""That's it? Fine, I guess.""

One more major directing mistake. The sight lines were awful. I shouldn't be seeing the backs of people's heads when they deliver a monologue.

Go see it for the story and for Laurie Metcalf, or just buy the play and read it.",6,2024-07-19 14:04:49

In terms of Micah’s performance I have to agree slightly. My friend and I thought maybe he was putting on some trauma-induced Idaho accent but we also assumed there was a level of something that we felt the director should ask he pull back on. That said, he had some incredible deliveries of one-liners.

We live two blocks from the bar and can easily replenish product throughout the day from our refrigerator.

Part of the appeal of Jackson Park is that you can get a Saturday morning tee time fairly easily and it is $28 to walk the course. The talk of caddies makes me think that even the resident rate will be above $100. Most golfers that play here will no longer be able to afford it.

khui3z9,19606fz,fumar,"There's several glaring flaws but would not be the worst problems to have. The circle line and red line wouldn't have enough capacity because of the interlining downtown and the interlining between the brown and circle line for two stops reducing overall capacity on all 3 lines when the two that exist are at capacity already. 


The red line express is a good idea that Evanston would riot about. It also should still have a stop at Addison (at least during game day) and would require a bunch of stations to get redone otherwise you would have to switch tracks between Belmont and Addison and that would likely cause a bottleneck.


A lot of these other new lines and extensions are great but again, interlining in certain sections will kill capacity and should be avoided as much as possible.

khta648,19606fz,constituent,"I was like, ""Hey, I'd like that!"", when I saw the line extending on Devon.  Sometimes I prefer to *walk* that stretch instead of taking the 155.  All the road congestion, it feels like you're hitting every red light.

I had to read further to see it'd be a *subway* and not elevated.  With the amount of vehicular traffic routinely clogging Devon, somehow anything elevated would be impractical.  With much of that stretch having mixed-use buildings (commercial ground level, residential upper levels), tenants living there would certainly not find the noise pleasant.  Indeed, underground would be the smarter choice.

For that North-South stretch between Devon and Touhy, I'd guess it'd run directly under Kedzie without involving the river.  Centennial Park on the west side of the river was mostly-deforested this past year, thanks to [the installation of new sewage pipes](https://nadignewspapers.com/mwrd-sludge-pipeline-replacement-project-planned-for-devon-avenue/).  That park and North Shore Channel Trail look unrecognizable now.  While on that tangent, [a pedestrian bridge over the river](https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/08/10/pedestrian-bridge-planned-for-pratt-boulevard-over-north-shore-channel-in-west-ridge/) is planned at Pratt.  That'd be a relief because crossing at Devon or Touhy can be treacherous on foot or bike.

ctc9vox,3e7iyu,fsync,"Using a realtor/leasing agent to find an apartment generally means higher rent, since they charge landlords a fee. Keep looking on padmapper and domu. Sometimes it takes a little persistence.

Your budget will get a nice 2 bedroom around the part of Avondale very close to the Belmont blue line stop. In Logan/Bucktown you might have to settle for a 10 minute walk to the train if you want a $1500 two bedroom. Wicker Park is probably out of the question. Ukrainian Village and other parts of West Town are a possibility but you might not be happy with the walking distance to the train.",0,2015-07-22 11:45:17

It is also wise to have first months rent plus whatever other fee(s) are required at move-in in check form when you are touring (Chicago real estate moves fast) so if you truly like a place and it fits your criteria you can give them a check to hold the place while you put applications in for credit checks granting that there is no one ahead of you in line.",2,2015-07-22 13:31:24

""The House is amazing - we loved their Hammer Trilogy - but they also do other work outside of genre theatre, like their current musical of Hatfield and McCoy. InGen Productions is an ensemble of artistic engineers who utilize theatre, dance, and music to resurrect contemporary texts to the stage. What makes Otherworld Theatre different is that Science Fiction and Fantasy is part of our mission statement. We are dedicated to performing and promoting strictly genre work. The venue, and our future home, would be the only theatre space in the world dedicated to genre performance.

cib6sjw,28i922,noranina,"Hey fellow redditors!

A few years ago, when my friend Eliza and I were in acting school at Illinois State University, we read the play Bachelorette by Leslye Headland and fell in love. We were struck by the honesty of it's characters and their relationships to one another. Specifically, the complex qualities of female friendship. It had everything we loved. Humor, heartbreak, and more than a few badass, strong, complex roles for women. We feel the story that it tells is one that speaks to the modern twenty-something woman, a story that is rarely told with such brutal honesty. 

A couple years later, as roommates in Chicago, we decided that we didn't want to wait any longer to do something we were passionate about. We were tired of waiting around for someone else to provide us with the opportunity we wanted, so we decided to take matters into our own hands. We decided to produce the play ourselves this coming August. We have an incredibly talented cast and amazing team.

Currently, we are trying to raise money for the show. Just in case anyone is interested, here is the link to our indiegogo fundraiser page. I would be so grateful if you would check it out and consider sharing with anyone who you think might be interested!

Thanks in advance for all your support!!

ldxok16,1e74439,rebelintellectual,It's a real great show fly by and has a lot of depth for a couch on a stage with 4 actors in the production. ,8,2024-07-19 09:35:46
ldz1iur,1e74439,sydeffex,"My wife and I were able to see an early preview of this show, so my experience may not reflect the final product. But I felt like the director, Joe Mantello, really missed the mark. This review rightly praises Sam Hunter and Laurie Metcalf, and leaves out everything wrong with the production.

Sam Hunter's writing is brilliant. In every one of his plays (and the movie adaptation of The Whale), you get to know these isolated humans who desperately need another human to connect with them. When lifestyle, money, media, politics, religion, sexuality, and even our own physical bodies get in the way of that connection. If you liked LBRR, then you should also go see his other play currently playing in Chicago - ""The Case for the Existence of God"" at Steep.

Laurie Metcalf is great and engaging, but the director only allowed her two tones to speak in; sullen or yelling. Micah Stock adopted this strange affect to his voice that makes him hard to understand or emote with. I literally thought the character was supposed to be autistic (which would have been brilliant, and a very Sam Hunter thing to include). But he just made a bad choice, and the director didn't pull him away from it.

I loved the simplicity of the set design; the feeling of being isolated in a dark black hole was there. But the staging needed one more SOMETHING. Show me stars, show me a void, make the couch sink into the stage, show me a hyper-realistic hospital room in stark contrast to the simplicity of the isolated living room, show me a single point of light in the darkness. I got the isolation, but I didn't get anything else that would deliver a catharsis in contrast to the isolation, so I left the theater with ""That's it? Fine, I guess.""

One more major directing mistake. The sight lines were awful. I shouldn't be seeing the backs of people's heads when they deliver a monologue.

Go see it for the story and for Laurie Metcalf, or just buy the play and read it.",4,2024-07-19 14:04:49

As for the ending, >!I disagree personally about the heed for hospital dressing. I thought it super powerful hiding her character as she withered away and she only slightly raised her hand. At least that’s what I could see on the main floor right.!<

In terms of Micah’s performance I have to agree slightly. My friend and I thought maybe he was putting on some trauma-induced Idaho accent but we also assumed there was a level of something that we felt the director should ask he pull back on. That said, he had some incredible deliveries of one-liners.

Same, and the response is almost always the same: ""I would, but winter.""

It's... not that bad. I was dreading it but it's honestly perfectly tolerable! And that kind of trade-off is worth it: to get away from the constant, low-level hum of anger and belligerence that threads itself everywhere, there... it makes a huge difference in quality of life. Even just driving here feels so different. Sure, traffic sucks, but you can put your signal on to attempt to merge and something amazing happens -- rather than people speeding up to block you out, people slow down and *actually let you in*. It's a lot of small differences, but it such an improvement.

> especially my LGBTQ ones

This worries me because you're right -- the ones I know there in the Orlando area have been there so long they don't notice the changes that have taken the last few years to develop. They need to get the hell out of there because what's coming is going to be way worse than it is right now.

Great research into a timeless problem.

The solution for proof of display is tricky.  It would be like a reverse proof of life in a kidnapping were the victim is photographed next to today's newspaper.  

I guess this photo could be done in nature where the season is evident and matches after the date of the ticket but before the hearing.  Like this year a ticket dated in the Spring might be vacated in a September hearing by showing a photos of sticker in place but partially obscured by a drift of sex exhausted cicadas.

I wouldn't compare that stretch of Division Street to Bourbon; it's not that wild. But Gold Coast Social has been a problem since it opened. The owners of the other nearby bars get together monthly? I think? to discuss issues and any complaints from neighborhood residents. I was told by an owner of another bar that they (GCS) weren't participating, although maybe they are now. This kind of put them in a bad light with the other owners. I know that fights have spilled out of that bar as well. When things were beginning to open up after the shutdown and Division Street was closed so the bars could have extended outdoor seating in the street itself, GCS's area looked like shit, day after day - tables and chairs piled up, never cleaned, etc. They just didn't care or didn't have a clue. When I go to CAPS meetings (those are neighborhood meetings wherein residents can talk with the local cops), I hear stories about problems residents have with GCS. I'd have to ask around if it's improved at all. So all this is just a way of giving you some context, not that that will be of much comfort to you.

BMI is suing for damages.  It's really stupid that Piece doesn't have a license, because this most likely is an easily winnable case for BMI (especially if the BMI rep recorded audio or video of the infringment).  The stupid part is that it actually got this far.  As soon as BMI notified them, they should have paid up (my opinion, but i'm not a lawyer anyway).

For those that don't understand music licensing - if you are a commercial establishment (like a bar/restaurant), you need to pay the licensing companies (BMI/ASCAP) to play music. These licensing companies collect license fees and distribute it back to the songwriters.

As long as the cover band isn't profiting of the tributes they play, BMI has **no reasonable explanation** for suing Piece. Yeah, they made a small sum of money from drink/food sales to customers attending said performances, but that *pales in comparison* to the amount of money made by the artists/labels from record and merchandise sales on a yearly basis alone (and that's not even factoring in the people that willingly pay for an album or song after hearing a cover of it).

1) Is someone who participates by singing ""karaoke""-- by which I mean a patron in a restaurant or bar volunteering to sing a song to his or her friends as part of a fun group activity -- considered a public performance requiring a license under the copyright act?  (Would the ""audience"" arguably consist primarily of a gathering of people within a family and its social acquaintances and thus not be a ""public"" performance under the copyright act ?) I wonder if there is any caselaw about it.

2) Assuming the activity under item #1 is not a public performance requiring a license, would musicians accompanying that singing amateur require a license for their part in the ""performance""?  Why or why not?  Would it matter if the restaurant paid them or if they just put out a tip jar?  

There would be no license required if I were to pay a musician to come to my house and play a selection of 80's rock covers for friends and family attending Thanksgiving dinner because it wouldn't be a ""public"" performance under the copyright act.",9,2016-02-18 11:54:49

However that track is owned by a freight company (forget which one), so I can't imagine Metra would have an easy time negotiating being able to run trains all day every 30 minutes on those tracks when currently they run five(?) trains per day and none on weekends.

io2o5d7,xbpnuq,None,"So, I believe Amtrak actually owns union station and Metra must pay some sort of fee to operate there, which can be frustrating for Metra since Metra has a much higher demand. As for the lone through track, Amtrak only uses it to board the Hiawatha and Empire Builders, which are the only northbound Amtraks leaving Union Station. The remaining Amtrak trains board on southbound platforms, along with 3 of Metra’s 11 lines. I speculate Metra would acquire this through track to board more BNSF, Heritage Corridor, and South West Servive trains",1,2022-09-11 21:19:15

Deutsche-Bahn was recently brought on to work with Metrolinx to create GO-Expansion, and part of their bid is as a way to save money they'll be reusing the same coaches and electrifying with electric locomotives. Whilst many aren't happy with this decision, as a way to minimize the negatives of using locos (mainly the reduced speed), DB and Metrolinx are hinting at their strategy is now to run smaller trains, and running those trains far more frequently (if a loco has to pull smaller and lighter trains, they can accelerate much faster). Based off the numbers Metrolinx has shown, it seems like the new headways are an average of every 5 minutes or so during peak hours, and 7-10 minutes off peak.",1,2022-09-18 12:05:22

If that’s any indication of how much we love them lol. Super traditional interior, glass window to watch them make the dumps, and always a wait bc it’s god tier. 

If you’re into it, they do exotic specials sometimes like lobster and uni filled ones as well. Obviously more pricey but totally worth it. 

What’s awesome is you put in a rec then go meander through some awesome other businesses while you wait and shop for oddities. Tour de jour does other worldly pastries, better than I’ve ever had. Ube milk breads and millions of other divinities.

lq08cpp,1fruy2y,damp_circus,"You're probably thinking of the Argyle street area. It's mostly southeast Asian focused (Vietnam mainly). There's a Hong-Kong allied supermarket ""Park to Shop"" that has a bit wider coverage of goods (you can get Japanese and Korean focused stuff there). But all the markets will have your basics and if you are particularly wanting stuff from Vietnam, everything is there. (Lots of good pastries too)

Quite a lot of noodle shops around Argyle. I like Pho 777 for whatever it's worth. Just get off at Argyle red line and stuff is right there, Argyle street itself and also south on Broadway from there.

Argyle too kinda... went on a downturn for a while, lots of empty storefronts, but it's getting more lively again.

My main need with these areas is supermarket shopping and home goods, that sort of daily life stuff, and I also appreciate some of the modern Asian stuff (including chains, yes) that come into the area, as someone grown up with that stuff. 

If you need Korean groceries (and wider variety of Japanese stuff) then the Korean market Joong-Boo near Belmont blue line will be the place to go, also H Mart (there's one near Union station on Jackson). The Super H Mart in Niles has absolutely everything from all over East Asia at least (north, south, southeast, Philippines...) plus endless Korean housewares, it's the absolute pinnacle of this sort of thing, but... it's in Niles, so I don't get out there too often.
 
88 Marketplace on west side of Chinatown pretty wide variety also.

Lately there's more and more stuff in Bridgeport. Got hungry walking around there and had some good Chongqing noodles.

Part of it is just technology changes. One big category of business (there, and also here too) was video rental of TV (VHS tapes and then later DVD of TV series for like $2 a week), and then bookstores. These days TV you can... DIY off the internet (not necessarily legally but no one cares LOL), and there's amazon and also local Japanese bookstores that sell books (e and paper) over the internet now, so again, you can just DIY. Little Tokyo had a record store I went to (Bunka-do, no idea if it still exists), but now there's Spotify and downloading whatever you want from youtube.

Ditto the bookstore inside Mitsuwa in Arlington Heights, used to be a more full service Japanese bookstore aimed at just regular people who wanted books, and they handled paper magazine subscriptions, now most people including me buy books online if we're wanting cheap books, so there's a small section still of Japanese books but most of the store is stuff aimed at anime fans and a lot more English translations of Japanese comic books.

I think as a society we've let some of these foods that were reserved for mid-level pricing get way too out of control. I fucking love chicken wings but things like wings and burgers should never be crossing the $20 threshold considering anytime you're eating at a bar that serves these types of foods, you're generally paying for alcohol as well which is up-charged absurdly high as it is.

I know it gets repeated way too much nowadays, but folks should be able to go out to a sports bar for a game, grab some wings or a burger + 2 beers and not have the bill be nearly $50+ for ONE person when all said and done.",257,2024-08-21 10:25:12

j23ym1c,zy63nn,1koolspud,I know the pandemic caused them to scale back their menu because I went there for pre-show dinners in early 2020 and I thought their steaks were the best deal in the city in terms of bang for buck.

They've been through many phases with the menu and food quality, and weren't at their best prior to the pandemic.   Closing for so long and losing their staff meant they were starting over with that same mediocre menu.  I feel like they had an era between 2014-2017ish where it was bomb, but those days are behind them.  Maybe they'll improve over time, but it isn't like they were hitting home runs non-stop since opening.

Nowadays I take the trip up to Old Irving Brewing for that type of thing.  They aren't quite as diverse with their everyday beer offerings, but their best beers are better than most of Rev's comparable offerings, and Old Irving's food is much, much better than Rev's ever has been.",24,2022-12-29 10:04:11

When we got to the bridge overlooking the lot it was so sad. At best only 30 people were there. One sandwich truck, one dude selling PBR and water and two vendors selling pipes and glowsticks. We made the most of it and it was fun. The one major complaint was the price, we paid 30 for both of us when people were trading cigarettes for entry, some only paid $5. You live and learn I suppose.

So yes, we need this ugly parking lot to keep tourists a bit of a distance.

Thanks for everybody who has been discussing and raising awareness of the video, It wasn't hard to find these little punks seeing as one of them was dumb enough to show his face, that was all it took, but it was still necessary to have the video go viral to be the catalyst. We got everybody from Mayer Rahm, to Vinnie (Jersey Shore) to speak about it! One by one they are being arrested and detained for questioning. This was in no small part thanks to the Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and even 4chan community for expressing their total and utter outrage at this video. 

edit: Yes, The water is not entirely clear on the motives/intentions, but what's important is that the suspects are detained and the context of the situation can be properly assessed",34,2012-01-17 16:16:05

c3i186f,ok646,GuyWithAids,"For those of you who don't want to go through this whole thread looking for information, here is a **SUMMARY** (Please correct me if any of this is wrong or needs to be updated)

-Youtube is taking down a lot of videos but there are plenty that can be found. There is a 3 minute version and a 2 minute version. The shorter version is missing the end where the Chinese guy is running away.

-There are a lot of deleted comments on reddit because they included the names of the people in the video. These names were found by people at 4chat (my guess). They say that 4 of them were asian and 2 were hispanic.

-Chicago newspapers/news stations have gotten a hold of this story. They had it on the news at night and have articles about it. They tell the story and say that the kid getting attacked went to the hospital but is now at home. He also got $180 stolen from him.

-There are videos of someone getting arrested. They are saying it is the guy who showed his face. I have found no proof that the video is actually the kid.

**Rumors**

-A girl (believed to be the attackers girlfriend) posted 2 videos saying that the kid that was beat up was apart of a group of 20 people who jumped one of the current attackers and his cousin. She says that they were just getting revenge.
-Some people say what she is saying is correct. They have found her name and facebook and she does go to the right school. Some people also think they hear the attacker say (You fuckin' jumped me with 20 people! You think that's funny?!)

-Some people think the girl who posted the video was holding the camera. (No proof of this except that they think she giggled when the guy started to run)

-There is this guy on youtube who says that he knows the real story. He says that the guy who was attacked was new to the school and tattled on one of the kids his first day of school. (No real evidence saying that he is right or if he is even from the same school)

hn6wa8b,r8pdf2,CosmoVerde,"While looking for Chicago themed playing cards about a month ago I discovered that there were a lot of different decks that were made 1933/34 Chicago World's Fair. In the process I also discovered a couple of different Delta Airlines promotional decks. I covered a sealed Delta deck (C. 1976) [here](https://reddit.com/r/playingcards/comments/qi080w/opening_a_sealed_deck_of_1970s_delta_airlines/).

For about a month I keept an eye on Chicago World's Fair decks. I got out bid on a couple and couldn't come to an agreement with the sellers of others. Last week I saw this sealed example pop up. After a quick search I saw that other sealed decks were listed for ~2-4x the price of this one's starting offer. Obviously that isn't an indicator of actual value (they might not ever sell at their list price) but I made a few offers and the seller and I came to an agreement. I managed to buy this sealed deck with a good condition box for approximately the starting bid of the average good condition opened/ used deck that I missed out on.

This deck will say sealed (unlike the Delta deck). It features standard faces so I don't feel the need to open it, either. I do want to get a good condition opened/used example of a Chicago World's Fair deck that features a black and white photo of a different attraction on the face of each card. Ironically I'll probably be spending more on that deck than I did on this nearly mint one but that's just because I got a really good deal. If I ever get one I'll be sure to share it here!",29,2021-12-04 07:10:52

I think as a society we've let some of these foods that were reserved for mid-level pricing get way too out of control. I fucking love chicken wings but things like wings and burgers should never be crossing the $20 threshold considering anytime you're eating at a bar that serves these types of foods, you're generally paying for alcohol as well which is up-charged absurdly high as it is.

I know it gets repeated way too much nowadays, but folks should be able to go out to a sports bar for a game, grab some wings or a burger + 2 beers and not have the bill be nearly $50+ for ONE person when all said and done.",259,2024-08-21 10:25:12

BMI is suing for damages.  It's really stupid that Piece doesn't have a license, because this most likely is an easily winnable case for BMI (especially if the BMI rep recorded audio or video of the infringment).  The stupid part is that it actually got this far.  As soon as BMI notified them, they should have paid up (my opinion, but i'm not a lawyer anyway).

For those that don't understand music licensing - if you are a commercial establishment (like a bar/restaurant), you need to pay the licensing companies (BMI/ASCAP) to play music. These licensing companies collect license fees and distribute it back to the songwriters.

1) Is someone who participates by singing ""karaoke""-- by which I mean a patron in a restaurant or bar volunteering to sing a song to his or her friends as part of a fun group activity -- considered a public performance requiring a license under the copyright act?  (Would the ""audience"" arguably consist primarily of a gathering of people within a family and its social acquaintances and thus not be a ""public"" performance under the copyright act ?) I wonder if there is any caselaw about it.

2) Assuming the activity under item #1 is not a public performance requiring a license, would musicians accompanying that singing amateur require a license for their part in the ""performance""?  Why or why not?  Would it matter if the restaurant paid them or if they just put out a tip jar?  

There would be no license required if I were to pay a musician to come to my house and play a selection of 80's rock covers for friends and family attending Thanksgiving dinner because it wouldn't be a ""public"" performance under the copyright act.",9,2016-02-18 11:54:49

 Just captures a certain time and place for me. Open late. Cheap but not boring food. Video store / rental place downstairs. Eclectic, overstuffed decor like a circus from hell - defiantly different from the minimalist industrial loft look that was becoming popular even then. Big booths where you could bring in a book or a copy of the Reader and just chill for a while without staff or other patrons giving you the stink eye.


 Nothing special at all, but it just captures the feeling of ""what Chicago restaurants used to be"" for me, in a way I really miss.

&#x200B;

* I love the mornings after it snows overnight in my neighborhood because everyone is out there together shoveling and it really feels like a community moment. The middle aged dads on my block take turns shoveling for our elderly and disabled neighbors. Everyone greets everyone else and chats while hard at work shoveling together. Usually someone comes out and shovels out a bunch of our street because the city doesn't come by and do it for hours.
* I love the huge old trees in the parkways on residential streets, in the parks and boulevards with their colored leaves in the fall and the green they add to the neighborhood all summer.
* I love that we live in a city but it is still easy to get out and see some nature.
* I love all the live music events outdoors all summer long, even when I don't go to them, there's something about just walking by and hearing folks make music.
* I love the Chicago park district and the many awesome classes they offer across the city in arts, music, sports and more for surprisingly affordable prices.
* I love the Chicago public library and their many, many, many cool events, amazing resources and awesome buildings.
* I grew up at the various Chicago museums, and love all the things they exposed me to outside of my bubble through the wonderful work they do.
* I love that we have free conservatories and a free zoo that you can visit.

When I lived on the east coast for a few years while I was in school, I missed home so much in a lot of ways that I didn't anticipate. The freedom to walk, bike and public transit to most of the places I wanted to go was something that I never really appreciated until I lived in a place where you'd have to drive to go anywhere. I also missed the linguistic diversity that you experience everywhere here on the streets, in the shops and in your community.

There are never carts at the entrance. Sometimes they don’t even have enough carts for all customers and people have to wait around by the exit to snag one.

On two occasions in the past six months, they were out of garlic.
On three occasions in the past six months,they were out of red onions.

How does a store of this size/customer base not have these items in stock 100% of the time?

Good luck finding herbs. They’re constantly out of one or two items; rosemary/thyme/dill.

Last week, I was only able to find 3 bags of regular pita in the whole store. All same brand/type- no variety.

At peak hours they will have one, maybe two checkout lanes open. They expect you to use self checkout. This takes forever when people are slow, checking out 20+ items, machines bug out (please place item in the bagging area), etc.

He opted to just shut down the bar without trying to sell the name/concept. 

The landlord said he had tried to work out reduced rent/deferrals with all his restaurant tenants, but the clipper guy demanded to pay zero and not have to make it up after the pandemic. Some of the landlords other tenants came out and said that he had been really generous with them trying to find alternate rent arrangements to help them survive the pandemic.

The core theme connecting it all is that Chicago is a city that is constantly transforming, and Chicagoans heartily adapt to those transformations while living rich and happy lives. Each cataclysm, like the Great Chicago Fire, just adds to the character and history of the city.

i2i9p15,t9v4xm,bahamut000,"Jaleo was a big disappointment for us.
We went with a group of 6 and they assured us that they would scale all the dishes to the size of the table. 

This is important because you can't choose two items per couple at the table; the entire table has to order the same things for the various courses. what a bummer for shareable tapas
(Ex:6 people could pick 6 dishes, instead you have to choose 2 for the table to share regardless of party size)

So we didn't get to try all the things on the menu and to boot we felt that they shorted us on the actual amount of food we should've gotten.

They brought out 4 (2 per) of the ""meat"" dishes we got, a ""local whitefish"" as well as a singular pork sausage with white beans. (the third option was cauliflower.. where's the meat?)
If we had 6 people and they scaled the dishes to the party size why did they bring out 2 sausages?  is the per couple serving size 2/3 of a single sausage?  it should have scaled to 6 total ""meat"" dishes; 2 per couple per the menu.

To cap it all off they tried to charge a 2 year old we had with us for a full adult tasting, she ate more of the grapes her parents brought from home than the actual food that wasn't portioned for 6 much less 7 people.

The tapas weren't even that good...would not return.",10,2022-03-28 19:49:55

There's pretty much no chance of getting a table via walk-in on a Friday or Saturday night.

1. There's two menus: the $39 street food menu, and the $55 Hansik menu. We went as two and ended up getting one of each. The waiter recommended that we choose the first option under each course, which is the meat option, so we did that except we got braised radish as the starter on the street food menu.

2. Overall both menus are quite good. The clear standout is the grilled octopus dish (10/10), followed by the glazed pork belly (8/10) and the crispy vegetable medley (7/10) imo. The LA galbi and duroc pork belly is prepared on the grill at the table and about the quality you would expect at a decent KBBQ place (so it wasn't bad by any means, just nothing really special).

3. We were pretty full and only had a few leftovers. If you are going as three, I'd imagine you could get away with just going for one of each menu and still be reasonably satisfied. If you are going as two, two of the Hansik menu is probably going to be too much food. If you are going as one, I'd go for the Hansik menu.

4. Ambience is nice and tables are comfortably spaced out.

5. We ended up paying ~$200 for the two menus and four cocktails (including tips). I didn't look at the bill closely, but I think the restaurant added a 5% surcharge to the final bill as well, so look out for that in case you're not expecting it.

Summary: great place, some really good courses as well as a few creative ones across both menus, portion sizes were good, service was attentive, no complaints, 9/10",3,2022-03-28 20:42:10

c3pau4h,pfk5x,moSennsi,"If you are looking for A safe, affluent yet quiet neighborhood, Bridgeport is your best bet. Northside neighborhoods will provide a lot of nightlife excitement, but neighborhoods like Lincoln Park are full of college kids and these neighborhoods are not very cheap. I think for ~1400/month you could find plenty of solid 2 beds in Bridgeport.

Located just a short train ride south from the loop, it provides easy access to good nightlife, yet there are only a few small bars in Bridgeport. It is very quiet at night, as it is strongly family oriented with a small population of IIT students. You will not have the greatest selection of Restaurants or museums in Bridgeport, but the Zhou B Art Center and Bridgeport Art Centers are attracting artists to the neighborhood. 

In summary, if you want a safe neighborhood (that happens to be full of Cops), with reasonable rent and close proximity to Downtown/North side, Bridgeport is the way to go. The reason Bridgeport is so charming to me is that it sticks out. Neighboring Mckinley Park has some gang issues, Chinatown is a bit dirty, and the neighborhoods south/Southeast of Bridgeport (Washington Park, Englewood) are real shitty..... So, definitely come check out Bridgeport, it is a great neighborhood for walking the pup, but do not go exploring south of Bridgeport.",6,2012-02-08 18:28:37

My summary: 

•A handful of MMJ patients vocalized concerns over high costs of medicine and inquired about whether legalization will bring down costs for them. Short answer: over time

•Other common concerns were the fate of contributor's to the IL blackmarket, which supplies 98% of users in the state, as well as the role of minorities, cannabis criminals, and those disproportionately effected by prohibition.

Senator Heather Steans and Representative Kelly Cassidy stressed the fact that it was essentially DAY ONE of the legalization campaign and that the next step is to call your local representative.

kv2c0m9,1bbd8ck,kreplachkid,"Hey Everyone!

Want to provide an update (along with an observation and lesson learned) for the six to eight people who might potentially give a shit.  

First, thank you everyone for your suggestions.  While Chicago goes hard on pastries and delightful breakfast options, I feel like there is a big gap in the good ol fashioned bakery department.  Being familiar and a fan of Spinning J and Loaf Lounge, I started there.  Both were very similar, the retail seems to exist to support surplus from the restaurant, and it was a roll of the dice if they could accommodate from a timing and quantity perspective (please note this is NOT a complaint, it doesn't fit their business model and that makes sense).  I then saw pictures of those sourdough muffins at Au Levain and thought that needed to be my next target, until I saw a Sunday pickup only (needed them for Saturday).  Next I tried calling Reno.  After ringing a few times got a voice recording letting me know the phones are not working and to email someone.  I emailed them with no response.

This finally takes me to my lesson learned:  when you crowd source a request to Reddit and there is a top up voted comment, you listen.  Admittedly, my snobby Chicago bias prevented me from going straight to Santa Monica Summer House.  A California name!?  A chain with locations outside of Chicago!?  Couldn't be me.  Well, finally I checked them out and arrived to find piles of delicious, homemade English muffins.

Thanks again everyone for the help, it was a journey.",2,2024-03-15 18:07:41

Also if you wanted to do it up for the evening, the the restaurant is located within the Palmerhouse hotel which also houses The Magic Parlor. A cocktail hour where cocktail attire is suggested but not mandated. You can couple dinner then a magic show. dinner is all inclusive in which they provide the magic menu for you to choose from. It’s bevrages, an appetizer, an entre, and desert for 41$ once tacked on to the magic parkour price of 79$. It comes out to 120$ total. It’s entirely worth it and drinks during the magic show are free. At 79$ that’s usually the price of about 7 cocktails/glasses of wine/bubbly. Get sauced during the show and you’ve come out ahead! I’ve gone twice, it’s great!!! Everything, the magic, the food the atmosphere etc. you can’t go wrong.

I can’t stand when people talk down about this restaurant just because the dish of choice is “supposed” to fall within a certain arbitrary price range for seemingly no reason. Who are you to claim what the definition of ramen is?

You’re criticizing the pricing of a restaurant that is pouring its heart into making the best bowl of ramen they can. They make basically every element of the dish in house. No shortcuts. I know Mike personally, and he tries incredibly hard to not overcharge for his food while still remembering that he has a business to maintain and a hardworking staff to pay an affordable wage, all while being located in an expensive and competitive neighborhood of Chicago. If $25 for a meal (which, in the grand scheme of Chicago dining is still on the very affordable side) is what it takes to maintain an independently owned restaurant of this caliber, then I absolutely say it is a fair price.

If you think that is dramatic, sorry. I’m passionate about supporting Mike and his dream ramen shop. Restaurants have a hard enough time staying open these days with the rising costs of food and labor.

It’s ramen. Ramen with extra love in every slurp, maybe, but still ramen. My original question was simply “is this ramen really worth the price and exclusivity?”Not meant to be snarky—I’m genuinely interested to know from people who have tried different local ramen shops. If I can get a comparable bowl at a similar or cheaper price with less hassle, I’m curious what exactly distinguishes this ramen. I’d love to know how you think it compares to a no-frills Santouka, for example.

I remember when people were frothing over his ultra-exclusive pop-up ramen events (which I could regrettably never attend due to price, selling out quickly, and limited seating). Sorry I may sound dismissive, but it does seem like a lot of fuss for what sounds like a normal bowl of ramen.

Who knows, maybe I’ll fall in love if I’m lucky to catch them during the 4 hours a day they’re open without waiting hours or days (weeks?) for a reservation. I’d be happy to support his business within my means and try it for myself.

The owners definitely went above and beyond with this buildout! Our pricing is competitive with other BBQ joints of our caliber. We pride ourselves on using Berkshire and/or Duroc pork and the highest quality ingredients!

With 8-10 people, it might be kind of tight but you could always go earlyish and sort of just congregate around the bar or tables. Great bar food and just a very chill vibe (Village Tap can get kind of loud music wise but not like crazy clubby). Four Moons has pool and an old school jukebox.

lqktv8b,1fwwsp2,bestselfnice,"Service is atrocious at broken barrel. You won't see your server for 30+ minutes at a time. They might change a TV an hour later if you dare to ask to put a game on (while they have all the TVs split between two random games nobody cares about). Like, getting a Cubs game on a TV there was always a herculean task, while a half dozen are all playing a rebroadcast of some rodeo or some shit.

Menu descriptions are mere suggestions. The dish you receive might have half of what was listed. They might give you a Brussel sprout salad without Brussel sprouts while simultaneously randomly subbing something on your Mediterranean platter for Brussel sprouts. Actually happened at my table once. Ordered their sundae, which was supposed to have a half dozen ingredients and toppings, and was unapologetically given a goblet of ice cream with chocolate syrup and nothing else. You likely won't get a round of waters sitting on the back patio on a 90 degree day unless you go steal cups from the back bar and fill them yourself from the cooler next to it. 

A table of 8 that orders a round of drinks will get 5 or 6 brought out, with 2 of them completely wrong. You might see the other two 20 minutes later with the server rushing away before you can try and order food. Another favorite of mine was waiting 45 minutes for a server to even come over and then being told you can't order from the brunch menu because it is now literally 1 minute past their brunch hours. 

They were my sponsor bar for years and my team all agrees to go elsewhere, at the expense of the free beer were supposed to get there, because the experience is always so incredibly terrible.

Some other fancy-ish dinner suggestions are Rose Mary , Dear Margret, Kai Zan, Elske, Parachute, Bavette’s, Daises, Roister, & Lula Cafe. Went to Tortello recently and it was delicious but more of a casual vibe (you order at the counter but then get to eat fresh pasta in their lovely patio. Sometimes they also have live music as well!)

Kumiko in west loop is next level for cocktails. Very dressed up. I also like Scofflaw in Logan & Lazy Bird in the west loop (they have an extensive drink menu.)

I'm not trying to dissuade you from it.  It's worth the experience and I'd take Tzuco over Topo any day of the week, I assure you.

Personally, I've decided I'm done with ""amazing chef does Mexican cuisine"".  Very few chefs get the level of nuance a Mexican grandma gets, and yet the gramma does it for a fraction of the cost and with more grace.  If you want Mexican while you're here, and your list is seriously lacking in that department, save the money and the pomp, and get to Little Village or Pilsen, and have an amazing, casual, and authentic meal.",1,2024-01-09 17:51:21

gx7d2ec,n6hu9p,Raccoala,"That's a good looking agenda. A couple suggestions that you can totally ignore and still enjoy your visit:

Pair the Cubs game with Lincoln Park exploration instead of Wicker Park. Both Lincoln Park and Wrigleyville are along the lake and the red line train whereas Wicker Park is further west (and south) of Wrigley on the blue line.

I would  consider some of the more famous museums if this is your first visit, but I'm guessing you did your research if you settled on Driehaus and Photography.

Eataly is fun, but if you've been to any other Eataly then you've experienced it. It isn't really ""Chicago"", but still a fun tourist attraction with really good food and wine.

I'd recommend the Signature Room in the Hancock over the Skydeck. Similar views, but a nice sit down bar area in addition to a tilting thrill window (no need to go for dinner).

I had to look up Luke's and it looks like its a beef and dog spot by the river. I'd say to go to Al's on Taylor, Mr Beef on Orleans or Portillo's in River North or South Loop instead. (Other's that are familiar with Luke's might disagree)

Have fun!",16,2021-05-06 17:04:57
gx7ayyk,n6hu9p,optiplex9000,"The best food in Chicago won't be downtown, you'll need to venture out into the neighborhoods for that

Skip Beatnik for brunch, try going somewhere in West Loop. Little Goat would be great if you can get a reservation

Fatso's is a good burger, but not one I'd recommend really seeking out as a tourist. Au Cheval or Loyalist would be a better choice for a destination burger

There's a lot of good choices for Indian. Rooh is a chain, but is very high quality. Superkhana does fun modern spins on Indian food. Rangoli and Cumin are more 'traditional' places for Indian and both are wonderful

gx7ya1p,n6hu9p,Birdonahook,"Solid list. Fatso’s is great and a solid local spot, one of my favorite burgers in the city. People will recommend other places, but having a good mix of local stalwarts and popular hotspots is the best way to explore IMO. Mott st, loyalist, au cheval and ... shake shack are good options too though. But stick w Fatsos and explore Ukrainian village. 

Beatnik has excellent ambiance. I’ve only been to the west town location, but i take out of towners there just to wow them with the space. Food is also great. 

If you’re going to Lincoln park, see if you can get breakfast or brunch reservations at north pond. Eating breakfast overlooking the park is amazing. Otherwise le creperie (I forget if they’re still open). 

For breakfast in the loop, Lou Mitchell’s is not too far and can be fun. Cherry circle room, Cindy’s, drawing room or anywhere in Chicago Athletic association building would be excellent. Tea time at Allis is also a solid option. 

For low key drinks downtown, try three dots and a dash. Or better yet, head over to Fulton market and get cocktails and snacks at a mainstay over there (short cab ride), there’s plenty to pick from.",4,2021-05-06 19:59:06

(Edit: Alternatively, near Eataly is the Starbucks Roastery. They have a full service Italian restaurant in it, and it could be in interesting choice if Eataly's current state doesn't have what you need and you still want to be near Michigan.)

I would also comment, if you are going to a Cubs game and you want to wander a neighborhood with pretty homes, you might do better going to Lincoln Park or North Center up through Lincoln Square than Wicker Park for that day. It'll be easier to get to the game if you're near the Brown or Red lines too. Although do expect crowds.",6,2021-05-06 16:51:39

ldescm7,1e46sad,Remarkable_Giraffe24,"The challenge when it comes to predicting or feeling like a restaurant deserves a Michelin star is Michelin's unpredictability and inconsistency.  Does Cariño deserve a star?...sure, but also maybe not.  That's not anything against the restaurant, but purely based on the fact that we don't really know what Michelin is going to do.  In recent years, there has been a bit of a trim with restaurants both losing stars as well as starred restaurants closing: North Pond, Goosefoot, Temporis, etc.  With some personal surprises, e.g. Galit getting a star (I LOVE the restaurant but the Michelin Star doesn't seem to quite fit IMHO), Schwa keeping theirs (which pains me to say but I just don't feel like I'm having consistent experiences there anymore), Kyoten still not even having one star (we get it, Otto came out of the gate too hot and ruffled feathers, get over it already it's incredible there), Claudia getting a star (I'm sorry but I thought there was a mistake when I saw that).  That being said, Cariño is a toss up for me.  Seeing not only Brass Heart but also places like Jeong being snubbed for years doesn't bode well.  Cariño does seem to have reinvented themselves quite successfully and I've now had the tasting menu twice and the taco omakase once, and there are mostly hits but still some misses for me.  I do think Cariño is a very good and in many ways a great restaurant, but that elusive star is just that.  As a Chicagoan who travels for food and considers it a passion, I love to see the independent-owner/non-restaurant-group dining landscape in Chicago blossoming.  However, it doesn't do us any favors if Michelin stars become diluted.  When Longman & Eagle and Dusek's had their stars removed, I thought it was an appropriate decision and strengthened the meaning of the star.  If Cariño can keep pushing, I certainly think they will be in contention, but I don't think it's a slam dunk just yet. ",18,2024-07-16 00:43:41

ldw8i4q,1e46sad,Remarkable_Giraffe24,"Did the proper tasting a few weeks after opening and had a sweetbread course that were overcooked and liver-y.  The beef course that night was out of place and a bit bland, which was surprising considering how well seasoned the other dishes were. 

Did the taco omakase and thought that it was the super experience compared to both of the tasting menus I did: I just really liked the more casual approach and feel like the flavors and whimsy are more exciting and enjoyable compared to the dining room tasting menu.  I thought a couple of the tortillas were a bit doughy, which I thought might have been intentional but didn't align with the textures of the other offerings, so I assume it was an error.

The last tasting menu I did was superior to the first but still had a couple refinement issues.  The chicharron was a bit styrofoam-y compared with the ethereal version I had prior and the langoustine I was served was mushy.

To be clear, I think Cariño is a very solid restaurant and will return often to see how things evolve.  As mentioned in my original comment, ""I love to see the independent-owner/non-restaurant-group dining landscape in Chicago blossoming"".  I would much rather analyze my meals with a fine-toothed comb at places like Cariño, before going to a large-group owned restaurants with no soul and robotic service.  I am open with my critiques when asked by staffers with the hopes to provide some constructive criticism, not to receive any discounts.  If they do decide to discount me, I always return the favor onto the gratuity as a sign of true support.  

Respectfully, it's very very rare for ""everything to hit for me"", not because I try to be critical, but because I use the best of the courses as the standard for the other courses in a tasting menu. Whenever I'm asked: being honest, but also polite with said honesty has almost always been received with open arms and appreciation.  Do I want Cariño to get a Michelin star?  Abso-fucking-lutelty! Do I think that offering my honest feedback when I'm asked proves valuable at times?  I certainly hope so.",2,2024-07-19 02:12:31

He kept suggesting Bill’s for our lunch spot when we worked construction together because it was “awesome; it’s so cheap.” and when I asked him if the food was good he kept saying “yeah it’s super cheap, you can be full for like $4” and I kept asking “but is the food *good*?”

I don’t care how cheap it is, I worked hard to have money now. I want to eat good food and have new experiences out. Just because it can be cheap, doesn’t mean it has to be.

I've decided I just should never consider eating a meal like this because my restrictions / tastes would likely be an insult or at least an annoyance to a chef who has crafted a certain experience / set of dishes - or I'd be paying astronomical money for dishes where I'd avoid a number of them due to that.

Is there truly a way for someone like me to experience this sort of dining once in a lifetime? Or am I correct that I should just stick to a place with a menu I can read and decipher rather than this sort of experience?

You can always count on a string of people bringing it up any Mexican food thread. Kind of like how Red Hot Ranch will always come up, even if someone asks about high-end burger places. 

I find it a little interesting that there are such opposite views of the carne asada in this thread though. OP said they didn’t like it. A few comments saying it’s the best.  

Personally prefer: 
- Carnicerias Guanajuato (usually get carnitas) 
- Taqueria La Zacatecana 
- Tony’s Burrito Mex (which some people here recommended) 
- Primo Chuki’s (best veggie tacos) 
- Onions and Cilantro (only been there once)

lqnt71w,1fx8d1w,Coupon_Ninja,"Ive been wondering why the carne isn’t great here and other places. Twice i have seen the raw meat and the way it’s prepped. First it should be skit steak that’s been marinaded. I don’t know what the cut of meat is, but twice I’ve seen the cooks (during the slow times like 2-4 pm), dump a bag of frozen beef parts (size and shape if you make a “C” with your hand) and begin cooking it all down - presumably for the dinner rush later. It was at least a 25 pound bag. Anyway, they cook it all first. And then reheat it later. That’s akin to grilling hamburger patties and serving them hours later. You lose a lot of flavor and texture. 

Not to mention the raw lettuce and tomatoes (Like a BLT!!) put into the burrito (new to me as a California native  who’s lived her 3 years and tried dozens of places *all over* town) and then continue to cook the entire assembled burrito on the grill. That tortilla should have been precooked before assembly over a fire, or at least the flat grill, and both sides - not just the outside.",1,2024-10-06 14:12:06

>Paying extra to get uni at an omakase is a crime (this is definitely up there for one of the more pretentious and entitled sentences I've ever written publicly.) although the uni itself was amazing.  


This is a loaded statement. I cannot speak for Yume, and I've never been, but brand name uni does exist and can cost an astronomical amount, enough that I am willing to give places a pass on doing this provided they have something good, kind of like how many fine dining restaurants have caviar supplement for things. A half pound ish box of brand name, auction quality uni can run you cleably over $1000.


>When I went, all the fish was precut in a box but people I've talked to have said that they thought that was unusual and not their experience, so maybe I went on an off night. 


You will find a mix of this, and there really isn't a right or wrong way, although having pre cut means the chef can spend more time with guests and less time wiping things down.

Agree that Omakase Room doesn’t get the recognition in general that it deserves, as well as your hypothesis that it may have to do with its Sushi San/LEYE affiliation. I was put off by the upcharge on identical drinks vs pricing at regular Sushi San — felt like a cash grab that just left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Kyoten I will put up there with some of the mid-to-lower-high end omakase places in Japan (typing this currently while in the air returning from a 2 week trip there). Love also that Otto Phan is a bit of a wine nerd and prefers the unconventional. Doesn’t feel like he’s offering the most totemic or upcharge-able wines but rather is going with what he truly enjoys. ",2,2024-03-04 06:50:56

It’s tough of course but for the top 5 I’ll go with Uptown, Andersonville, Logan Square, West Loop and Pilsen. (I haven’t spent enough time in Lincoln Square and Albany park but in a perfect world I would Include a restaurant from one of those neighborhoods.

1. Uptown - Sun Wah - there’s great food across the neighborhood but this was easy bc the duck is iconic 

2. Andersonville - Little Bad Wolf - Such a gem and up there with Au Cheval for best burger in the city but without the wait

3. Logan Square - Lula Café - staple of one of chicagos top food neighborhoods, the first ones to do what they’re doing and now everyone copies. I’ll also throw out Table Donkey Stick as a bonus since their French/German food and wine selection is to die for.

4. West Loop - Publican - Known for their bread and meats but the main restaurant serves everything family style in a German beer hall. Roister was a close second as it also amazing and the mix of fancy and low key seems to represent west loop well

5. Pilsen - 5 Rabanitos - Maybe the best Mexican food I’ve ever had…the shrimp empanadas and Torta Ahogada were life changing",3,2024-07-07 14:27:38

Beoufhaus - classic example of a low key neighborhood joint executing at its highest level

JJ’s Thai - tastes like the food I ate every day when I was in Thailand (plus I eat it like once a week from JJs)

1. spice room - don’t get me wrong there are sooo many amazing Indian restaurants. I went to Loyola so I had plenty of time up on Devon and they’re all great. This is my husband and my go-to for takeout. 

2. Cafe Marie Jeanne - don’t care that it is closed I’m putting it down anyway. I miss it so much, they literally did not miss for breakfast or dinner. Staff were super nice too. My husband still complains about not having access to the jalapeño cheddar biscuits. 

3. La Chaparrita: why is it so good?! WHY. and their salsa is pretty good too. Best tacos I’ve had in chicago. 

4. Publican Quality Meats: this is a go-to brunch. Did so many sandwiches during COVID. The ribolita soup is soooo good. We grab stuff to grill when we splurging. 

5. Middlebrow: FINE. I can’t leave it off. Used to live a block from here and tbh it was the first place I went when you could wait in line to pick up stuff during Covid. They’re so nice, their staff policies are seemingly great, they have good NA options, both their brunch foods and pizzas are great. I’m heading over now with my husband to get coffee and a pastry. 


Honorable mentions: closed - Bom Bolla. Closest I’ve gotten to Spanish food that felt like when I spend time there with family. Closed - Jeri’s diner fucking ruled. Cellar Door Provisions - husband hates the crowd (he’s a crotchety old man tho) but the food is amazing and I want to go for my birthday next year. nhu lan - best bahn mi I’ve had here and they have a wide variety of options.

I love popular ""bbq"" dish of beef brisket on stone plate followed by kimchi - leftover banchan burnt fried rice on the same stone plate cooked in rendered beef fat. Also delicious recommendations are raw marinated crabs, raw spicy oyster and korean pear appetizer. Ahjummas there will come off as rude or trying to rush you, but don't take it personally. The cons are: no reservations, long queues during peak meal hours and you'll smell like kbbq after you're done dining there.

Chicago Kalbi is Japanese-Korean style bbq and vibes are more premium. Their meats are higher end cuts (e.g., imported A5 Waygyu, Kobe beef, different parts of the beef tongue, etc.) and more variety and quality tiers of cuts. All of the appetizers there are worth trying. I especially enjoy the Japanese moutain yam beef tartare. They also serve beer and sake. Service is much friendlier there.

>Paying extra to get uni at an omakase is a crime (this is definitely up there for one of the more pretentious and entitled sentences I've ever written publicly.) although the uni itself was amazing.  


This is a loaded statement. I cannot speak for Yume, and I've never been, but brand name uni does exist and can cost an astronomical amount, enough that I am willing to give places a pass on doing this provided they have something good, kind of like how many fine dining restaurants have caviar supplement for things. A half pound ish box of brand name, auction quality uni can run you cleably over $1000.


>When I went, all the fish was precut in a box but people I've talked to have said that they thought that was unusual and not their experience, so maybe I went on an off night. 


You will find a mix of this, and there really isn't a right or wrong way, although having pre cut means the chef can spend more time with guests and less time wiping things down.

Agree that Omakase Room doesn’t get the recognition in general that it deserves, as well as your hypothesis that it may have to do with its Sushi San/LEYE affiliation. I was put off by the upcharge on identical drinks vs pricing at regular Sushi San — felt like a cash grab that just left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Kyoten I will put up there with some of the mid-to-lower-high end omakase places in Japan (typing this currently while in the air returning from a 2 week trip there). Love also that Otto Phan is a bit of a wine nerd and prefers the unconventional. Doesn’t feel like he’s offering the most totemic or upcharge-able wines but rather is going with what he truly enjoys. ",2,2024-03-04 06:50:56

Not sure if you’re into music or shows, but Chicago has a great live music scene and many comedy shows available—these might also be worth checking into.  Millennium Park has a free concert series on the weekend that runs all summer long, or there are many local bars hosting live music events.  

Getting on the water, lake or river, is another one of my favorite things to do in Chicago summer.  Groupon sometimes has deals for architecture tour or other boats.  Water taxis are a cheap and underrated way to travel between popular ports downtown and see a different angle of the city.

\- I realize this is extremely concentrated in specific places - please, please comment with your suggestions so I can make the map more comprehensive and up to date. This was done based mostly on memory so there are a ton of gaps but I did want it to be reflective of the current situation.

\- Red doggy icon means dog friendly.

\- Green house icon means it's a rooftop.

EDIT: There are now two layers so you can toggle between legit patios vs. sidewalk patios

EDIT: Some of you have asked if there’s a way to copy this to your personal Google maps. There is - I’ll share links to the raw data after I add a few more pins and share some instructions on how to do it all (hopefully later tonight).

EDIT: This post has been up for just over 24 hours, and I have finished adding all of the recommendations here to the map. Thank you for the suggestions. I theoretically have a tactic to share CSV data so you can upload the markers into your personal G Drives but I’m stuck trying to find a way to do it without PII - so if there is anyone who is more technically savvy and is able to help please DM me.

In the meantime I am going to take a break for now but am happy that this is up and running before the Memorial Day weekend. I hope everyone enjoys the weather and a new patio. ✌️",131,2023-05-22 19:51:12

kzq2ykq,1c4uktc,Narrow-Lab-7743,"Great questions!  I started the show because, from the time I was a teenager, I loved to go out to all kinds of restaurants. I grew up in Chicago so there were all so many places to try and I love all food. Friends would ask me where to go and we'd explore.  Then, I moved out to the suburbs, had kids and I didn't dine out hardly at all.  I moved back to the city and it reignited my passion for restaurants. I wondered why there wasn't a TV show and I came up with Check, Please!. The show was kind of how I envisioned it (which is weird, but I had produced a lot of TV before) but I didn't anticipate the passion of the guests and how 3 people from different walks of life would interact so fluidly.  I also didn't figure on the impact it would have on restaurants. I always tried to make the show as genuine as possible and give it a feeling where viewers felt like they were overhearing a conversation about food.",17,2024-04-15 14:28:50

kzqzn20,1c4uktc,Narrow-Lab-7743,"So much here. The Host? Yes, in general, the host does or at least should go to all three restaurants. Not to review them, but to understand them. We did Tango Sur years ago and one of the guests on the show said, ""What's with the pictures of strippers on the wall?"" and Alpana replied something like, ""they aren't strippers, it's Eva Peron!"". She wouldn't have been able to say that if she hadn't been there and we would have removed the guests statment because we would've all looked silly. 

Not Airing an Episode? Besides the pretty well known Obama show, the only one I pulled was because one guest, about mid way thru, was clearly feeling the effects of taking some kind of pill and mixing it with alcohol. He started getting paranoid that the camera was following him and I'm like, ""WTF"". Anyway, I could've edited around him but I would've always known he was impaired and I try not to be an asshole. I think we re-shot it with a new guest and  tried to include the other two. 

Restaurant that has surprised me after the airing?  Several restaurants expanded their places after the show because, what some called, The Check, Please! Effect. In other words, super busy. Then I'd get a call like two years later asking if we could do another segment because they should not have expanded. We don't do return visits so...",5,2024-04-15 17:37:20

kzqxy9l,1c4uktc,Narrow-Lab-7743,"I started producing sports when I was just out of college and I got rejected from all the local news stations. I got hired as an non paid intern for a 24 hr cable outfit called, SportsVision which was owned by the local Chicago teams, and then, after eventually being hired there I moved over to ABC7 (one of the stations that rejected me) here in town. I started the same year as Michael Jordan and we are roughly the same age so we were very casual friends. Could there be a better time to be a Chicago kid and producing sports? As far as travel, I produced and programmed the inflight video for American Airlines for several years when they just had the big screens. I used to travel a week a month to produce videos about where they fly and they let me pick the spots so it was April in Paris, December in Maui, January in the Florida Keys.  I know, life was tough, right. Then, AA switched their Inflight Products people and they told me to start doing February in Philadelphia and March in Milwaukee. That was no fun.  To answer your question, I just really like people and love to tell stories so it doesn't matter if it's an athlete or a local shop owner or a chef.

k7o82kl,17mkeso,Hawxby,"As someone who moved to Chicago from AZ 5 years ago, I feel you OP. Chicago has some incredible Mexican food, but there is minimal Sonoran, and the little there is, is mid. I haven’t been able to find a proper bean and cheese burrito either- the beans and tortillas are just not the same.

Also, I am a little surprised/disappointed that the chicagoans in this thread don’t understand that. Especially considering the Italian beef- few and simple ingredients, but the quality and preparation is key to making it great.",20,2023-11-03 11:51:34
k7lny58,17mkeso,PurpleVomit,"People are going to clown you for asking for 7/11 Taco Bell ass food that can be made anywhere you ask including non-Mexican places.

Just FYI though, as you know Mexico is actually very big and has it’s own regional cuisines much like the US. In AZ, you’re going to get the Sonoran style Mexican food whereas in Chicago many of the immigrants have come from Jalisco and Michoacán so we tend to see more specialties from those areas.",122,2023-11-02 21:50:01
k7ngupo,17mkeso,b_knickerbocker,"To all the people saying OP is asking for Taco Bell food: you’ve clearly never been to AZ. 

Bean and cheese burros are a thing and they’re good. And I agree: most places in Chicago (that I’ve tried) add lettuce, pico, rice, and sour cream to everything. Go to South Tucson and order a birria burrito. Do you know what’s gonna be inside it? Meat. Marinated, cooked meat with spices and herbs and chiles. That’s it. Same goes for a bean and cheese: it’s gonna be beans and cheese. 

As some have mentioned, it’s all in the regionality of the cooking (and sometimes catering to Midwestern tastes). AZ is primarily Sonoran style cooking and, sorry OP, you won’t find that here.",37,2023-11-03 09:02:13

kb671fc,17mkeso,Major_Mycologist8794,"In Chicago you cannot get a legit bean and cheese burrito. You also can’t get a basic breakfast burrito (potato egg cheese -salsa on side). It’s a strange paradigm. Sometimes you go to a great burrito place requesting just beans and cheese and I cannot tell you how many times it doesn’t have just beans and cheese in it and you had to explain to a head scratching ‘confounded’ person that’s all you want and it’s still wrong or just shitty and small and you get charged $10 because they didn’t know how to ring it up. The breakfast burrito part isn’t even worth trying to find. As sad as this may sound, Taco Bell, bean burrito, extra bean extra cheese no onion is your best bet this is coming from someone who has lived in Arizona for 10 years spent two years in California and spent most of my life in Chicago. When I get that hard hitting craving for a B&C burro, that’s what I’m left with doing. If you really want it that bad out here you just have to take The time to make it your self.  Which doesn’t mean buy a can of refried beans, tortillas and add cheese, it means, actually making legit refried beans from raw ingredients gradients and taking the time to make it right.

j6x9miy,10rqxu6,Trustfundhobo,"100% agree with Lou’s. 

My favorite Lou’s vs Gio’s story happened WhenI worked at a hotel. Big group of Australia guys were visiting and mentioned the pizza in NYC. I asked em if they had any deep dish yet and they all looked at each other awkwardly and confessed that they didn’t like it. The called it “soft crust pizza soup”. Based on their description I guessed it had to be Gios or Chicago pizza and oven grinder. I asked and they confirmed my suspicions; they had gone to Gios. So I offered them $40 to buy a couple pizzas at Lou’s and told them it’s infinitely better; I didn’t want Gios to taint their views of Chicago pizza. Long story short they refused my money, they went anyway, loved it, and thanked me for the recommendation.

OP, if your reading this. Go to Lou’s and get a deep dish pizza well done. I think cheese for a first timer is the move, but also sausage or spinach is great too. Too many toppings and it gets to be a little too much and can be soggy.",11,2023-02-02 09:27:59

j7kipep,10rqxu6,kdollarsign2,"My recommendation regarding the Chicago art institute is to enter into the modern wing (it’s across from Millennium Park. No line and it’s all killer. You can enjoy that without feeling overwhelmed. I always recommend people pair this museum with drinks at Chicago Athletic Association— Gorgeous, sprawling art deco bar and tourist friendly. You mentioned Cindy’s so that’s on the agenda. I found the rooftop loud, crowded and unpleasant. But the main hotel bar is great.
I would skip drinks at the John Hancock and go a little more local with tiki at three dots and a Dash. I like Avec over Aba. 
If you’re two friends you might want to try to check out Aire spa - it’s incredible-skip the services and just enjoy the spa. Two hours there.
(Others are pointing you too far away for you to navigate/enjoy-I am personally northside but I would not recommend you venture to our tiny Chinatown or to Andersonville on such a short trip...) 
Bars- most people go out at night in the Fulton Market area, or Wicker Park / Logan Square. Check out Andros Taverna for dinner then bars around that area.

&#x200B;

close to you, i would check out steadfast, the purple pig, three dots and a dash, the nutella cafe, dorite donuts (best donuts in the city i think), firecake donuts.

&#x200B;

for chinese food specifically i will suggest my fav place ever, sun wah. its in uptown, id suggest taking the red line train there, in little asia, which is like our north side chinatown. get the roast duck. its the best. ",2,2018-11-08 14:43:52

lqktv8b,1fwwsp2,bestselfnice,"Service is atrocious at broken barrel. You won't see your server for 30+ minutes at a time. They might change a TV an hour later if you dare to ask to put a game on (while they have all the TVs split between two random games nobody cares about). Like, getting a Cubs game on a TV there was always a herculean task, while a half dozen are all playing a rebroadcast of some rodeo or some shit.

Menu descriptions are mere suggestions. The dish you receive might have half of what was listed. They might give you a Brussel sprout salad without Brussel sprouts while simultaneously randomly subbing something on your Mediterranean platter for Brussel sprouts. Actually happened at my table once. Ordered their sundae, which was supposed to have a half dozen ingredients and toppings, and was unapologetically given a goblet of ice cream with chocolate syrup and nothing else. You likely won't get a round of waters sitting on the back patio on a 90 degree day unless you go steal cups from the back bar and fill them yourself from the cooler next to it. 

A table of 8 that orders a round of drinks will get 5 or 6 brought out, with 2 of them completely wrong. You might see the other two 20 minutes later with the server rushing away before you can try and order food. Another favorite of mine was waiting 45 minutes for a server to even come over and then being told you can't order from the brunch menu because it is now literally 1 minute past their brunch hours. 

They were my sponsor bar for years and my team all agrees to go elsewhere, at the expense of the free beer were supposed to get there, because the experience is always so incredibly terrible.

The first time I went back in 2012ish I was absolutely blown away. It was incredible. I still think about that chicken with apples smoked in Miller beer - insane.

lw2nxh2,1gm3q33,Varnu,"I think you'd really be limiting your market with that branding.

Soul food has a very specific meaning to most people. And it's certainly not unpopular. But the demographics that want to eat soul food are not real broad. If you call it soul food, it's going to turn off part of the population that doesn't like soul food. And soul-food-enjoyers might show up and be negatively surprised to be getting maize and squash. That's the worst of both words, from a marketing perspective.

And when people hear ""Indigenous"" it sounds to most like they are getting a lecture. People don't know what they are getting and it isn't a term people associate with food. To the extant they do, it's grinding seeds in a bowl in the desert. You could call a restaurant ""ice cream cake"" and only serve fried chicken and explain to everyone that it's an inside joke you and your parents had as a child. But you're going to spend A LOT of time and money doing the messaging to get over that barrier to understanding what kind of place they are going to eat. You want the concept to be understandable unless you are going for exclusivity. And based on this post you probably aren't.  
  
A restaurant that had unique flavors and a unique concept based on pre-colonial American concepts would be *sui generis* here. It's easy to imagine it being a destination because there's only one place like it and the concept arouses curiosity. But you don't want to start it in a way where it takes a lot of time to overcome anyone's confusion about where they are going. That takes time and money and when you have a new restaurant and no established reach, all of that time and money is better spent making the reach broader and the experience better.",1,2024-11-08 07:17:22

Besides traspasada, there is a taqueria in the back of the grocery store right next to it.  They have daily specials.  Its pretty good, and excellent value.  I only say that bc traspasada's prices have gone up a little.  Mazamitla on Belmont is also great.

For a watering hole ... Avondale Tap is great.  Food is alright, decent drink selection, staff is cool, space is great.  Reed's is a complete dump and kinda weird, but if that's your style ... cash only if I recall.  If I'm feeling like a dive Frank and Mary's is better imho.

I live close to Chief's and its money.  Would be pricey for me to hang out there too much, but they do have beer specials on Wed or Thurs.  Its been a while.

Idk if smart bar is technically Logan or Avondale, but its awesome too.  Avondale straddles the highway and stretches pretty far east-west so idk if that's even within walking distance.  It is for me.  Similar caveat for Ludlow Liquors, which I like very much.

Beer Temple is awesome.  Tap room is phenomenal though I haven't been there since Jan.  I'm a cheap date, so I appreciate the free rye bread sticks.  Their bottle shop is great.  Staff is knowledgeable.  Capone's is also an excellent bottle shop.  Lots of wine too.  These aren't exactly obscure recs, but there's a reason for that.

Technically Irving Park but its close enough - Finom coffee is right on Irving just west of the highway.  Best cold brew I've had in a looooong time.  Beats the shit out of starbucks, intelligentsia, colombe.  Its been my favorite since I found it.",15,2020-09-18 09:26:59

luqai8w,1ggesoi,Third_Ferguson,"What follows is a personal, subjective assessment based on one person’s inherently limited experience. 

1. Violet Hour for the high-end, probably-need-a-reservation vibe. For those who don’t know, this is the home of the original Paper Plane. It is also the only speakeasy on this list. 
2. Scofflaw for a similar aesthetic but less stuffy (probably because it has windows) and similar tier drinks (imo). 
3. Heavy Feather for an even better, 70s aesthetic (great vintage-feel lighting) and non-innovative but solid cocktails. 
4. Estereo for a livelier atmosphere. Drinks are mostly fruit juice + brown liquor, so not really a mixology situation but they all taste good and the bar itself is beautiful, even in the harsh light of day. 

2, 3 and 4 are not going for quite the same “fancy cocktail bar” thing so if you’re looking to wow your date then Meadowlark may still be better (if you can’t get a spot at Violet Hour).",0,2024-10-31 12:46:16

My suspicion is that they aren't using proper rice. Bomba holds a firm texture and separation even after a long cook (which is actually a desirable quality in the best sushi rice too...hmm...), but it takes forever to cook, a big headache for a restaurant. Calasparra, for example, cooks way faster, and is a really easy substitute, even for restaurants in Spain, and I bet they're using it or one of many available blends of ""paella rice"" which don't use bomba.",3,2024-05-25 18:13:55

Admittedly, it was 60% even old timey-er before they remodeled it back before the pandemic… but it’s a solid spot. Also fun location, there under the L on Wabash. Also food is quite good in an old timey pub / almost supper club without the salad bar kind-of-way. At least it still was when I was last there 4 years ago (since moved 40 min out of the Loop, so don’t get back in all that often because I don’t have to).",14,2024-06-12 19:57:57

Because most of them didn’t have an hospitable bone in their bodies. They never tried to build regulars. They were rude. They ignored you. They blatantly used phones and chatted on the side. I struggled to enjoy myself every single time I sat at a table.

kjkxz66,19fng42,WP_Grid,">David Pisor — owner of Etta, Aya Pastry and Cafe Sophie — defaulted on a $2.5 million loan last week, a day before his Etta’s location in Scottsdale, Arizona, filed for bankruptcy. On Monday, Pisor abruptly closed Etta’s River North location, reportedly giving his employees two hours’ notice.

>His restaurant group has been struggling to pay its bills for months, according to a Jan. 17 loan default filing by lender Wintrust Bank in Cook County court, first reported by Crain’s Chicago Business.

>The now-closed Cafe Sophie in Gold Coast was served an eviction order in December, according to the filing. Pisor’s company owed over $86,000 in rent at the location at 847 N. State St.

>He and [James] Lasky opened Etta together in 2018 in Bucktown. The pair also cofounded Maple & Ash in 2015. But a bitter fallout and nearly year-long court drama ended with the pair splitting the restaurant group among themselves in early 2023. Lasky got Maple & Ash, while Pisor organized his restaurants under the Etta Collective. An ongoing lawsuit by Maple & Ash investors alleges financial malfeasance by its owners.",35,2024-01-25 17:47:59

The menu was limited and never changed in the 8 months or so since I started to go there. I'm pretty sure they did not have a full kitchen. The mini gourmet grocery store and wine selection made no sense with Potash less than a block away, Whole Foods a block away and Trader Joe's four of five blocks away.  That was absolutely wasted space.

They went for a dark interior which for a breakfast lunch place made no sense. The prices were high. 

In November, I think, the fancy menu on the big screen went black. That confirmed my suspicions.

I’d skip Etta (nothing special in a standout food city). And also skip Tanta (over priced, quality is hit or miss). 

If you’re worried about food allergy at Kasama, try going for dine in brunch. Arrive early. 

For great wine and vibes, you might also enjoy all together now. Their food menu is hit or miss sometimes, but usually great and the staff is usually very knowledgeable on wine and they tend to do great with funky and creative  “Midwestern casual” (so not fine dining). 

Monteverde a great option for solo dining, they have a good bar. And it’s worth going to.",38,2024-08-21 14:31:41
lj9f7ip,1exxsr3,Accomplished-Try-529,"Of all these places, Lula sounds like it'll be your best bet. They make artful, satisfying food, serve good wine, and have a welcoming alt/crunchy vibe. 

Tryzub is also great. I love their cold borscht. Just up the street from it, you'll find All Together Now, which is one of the city's best natural wine bars and has a particularly good brunch. 

In Logan Square, Cellar Door Provisions is a (still relatively?) underrated spot for interesting, thoughtful food and natural wine.   
  
You might need to ask them about allergy safety, but it shouldn't be much of an issue doing so as they're friendly and they keep their menu pretty tight. You certainly won't feel uncomfortable here. It's cool, laid-back, and witch-friendly (lots of herbs and fermentation, bohemian sensibilities, kind of a meticulous hippie thing going on). 

Honorable mentions: Bar Parisette and Rootstock.  
These two places, in Logan Square and Humboldt Park, respectively, should scratch the memorable wine itch as well.   
  
Bar Parisette is the latest iteration of my favorite French spot in Chicago. I'll give the small caveat that I haven't been yet, but have been meaning to. By all accounts I've read so far, it's even better than the last couple iterations.Their wine list online is impressive. Benchmark Nuits St. Georges and aged Cornas priced barely above retail.

Rootstock does really well with casual, seasonal wine bar fare. Their burger is superb, and they always have interesting wines by the glass. They've been around for ages and I don't know why they're not more hyped. 

Both of these are run by former employees of Webster's Wine Bar in Logan Square, apparently quite a local institution, which you may also want to check out.",14,2024-08-21 14:39:36
ljaae6i,1exxsr3,daiginjo666,"My partner is out of town two months a year and I love to solo dine even when she's away. I also love wine.  Avoid Etta, Girl and the Goat is OK, ba ba reeba is more fun for a group, not special for a solo diner. 




Lula is a good option for any time of day.  Alla Vita is an above average Italian restaurant, I like most of the Boka group places, but they can be a bit bland sometimes despite the excellent interior design. You could sit at the bar and get wine at nearly any of their restaurants and you won't be disappointed most likely: https://www.bokagrp.com/#




 Check out the Hogsalt restaurant group. Most of their places rule. Being a solo diner is great because you can find a spot at a large beautiful bar at a place with a great wine list. https://www.hogsalt.com/restaurants/ For example, you could sit at the bar at Ciccio Mio or Bavettes or Armitage Ale House. 




 A not-super-high-end Omakase is a fine place to solo dine, and you chat with other omakase counter people. I love Jinsea Motto and you could even do one of the ""Sushi by Bou"" places for something a little cheaper and still good. You could get a bottle of sake if you like that. These types of places could accommodate your allergy without breaking the bank by going to one of the great michelin spots.  


You could do Kumiko. The woman who runs the place is a total badass and from your self description I think you'd be glad you checked that place out.  




Amaru is also cool to solo dine, also sit at the bar, the service is great and they have some fun cocktails. They also own Bloom which is GF and Vegan. Excellent fried cauliflower. Can't remember their wine list. 




 Sepia is a more casual michelin spot with a massive wine list, I love going there. Can solo dine comfortably and they won't have any allergy problems. You'll find creative dishes and great wine. Not terribly hard to get a table especially during the week.  




Check out Daisies as well. You won't regret it. You could go to Le Bouchon for wine but the dishes are not that creative, though they're good French food. You could go to Apero, a good wine place with food.  




Tryzub is good. Monteverde was good.  Not super excited about the other places on your list. Kasama breakfast is OK and the dinner tasting is outside of your price range if you're trying to limit too many expensive michelin dinners. ",8,2024-08-21 17:24:16

lj9cakw,1exxsr3,ProfessionalRegion1,"Two major suggestions: strike off Ba Ba Reeba - it’s not bad, but it’s pretty mid for the price. Nothing I would go out of my way for.

Lou’s Lincoln Park is another I’d remove. I got one pizza there and threw it out, it was horrible, they’ve become very location dependent and so far the only okay one left I’ve been to is Lincoln Square. Pequods though is close by. It’s a bit overrated, but still quite good.

To the more minor stuff: Surprised to see Hexe on there, but highly recommend the banana bread. If you want another bakery, can’t go wrong with Lost Larsen, and there’s a few good places in Andersonville in general. Little Bad Wolf, is upscale-ish bar food and is a common one, and Minyoli just opened, still very new but I really enjoyed it - it’s Taiwanese noodles.

I really enjoyed Chengdu Bistro if you like Sichuan. Noodlebird has a complicated history, but it’s also usually good. Neither are super “can’t miss” admittedly, though the egg tart from Noodlebird is really good.",13,2024-08-21 14:24:13

lju9iw6,1exxsr3,maplewoodsid,"If you'll be in town on a Tuesday, middlebrow has a brilliant execution of tavern style that I'm pretty sure they start serving ~2 pm. Great spot to dine solo at! On Mondays, Bar Parisette across the street has happy hour all night. Le Bouchon, a true icon in Chicago, has half off the whole list the same night- if you want French food, this is the move. Also, north of those spots (just slightly- like usually under $10 for a ride share, or if you're cruising a long but not too long walk) you've got Common Decency (new but have beautiful cocktails and make a point of accomodations re: diet), Quality Time, and of course Cellar Door if you're after wine. Really commendable staff all around, as well (as long as you're nice). Also, right under the blue line is Lardon! If charcuterie, cheese, and great sandwiches are your vibe, don't miss them. 

On the square proper, highly recommend Cara Cara, Webster's, and of course Lula and Longman. My favorite indie bookshop, City Lit, shares a block with CC and Lula: the move, IMO, is to put your name in if (when) those spots are busy, cruise the bookshop, and hang in the park til they text you.

Edit: I blew it. Mi Tocaya is genius!

They might change a TV an hour later if you dare to ask to put a game on (while they have all the TVs split between two random games nobody cares about). Like, getting a Cubs game on a TV there was always a herculean task, while a half dozen are all playing a rebroadcast of some rodeo or some shit.

Menu descriptions are mere suggestions. The dish you receive might have half of what was listed. They might give you a Brussel sprout salad without Brussel sprouts while simultaneously randomly subbing something on your Mediterranean platter for Brussel sprouts. Actually happened at my table once. Ordered their sundae, which was supposed to have a half dozen ingredients and toppings, and was unapologetically given a goblet of ice cream with chocolate syrup and nothing else. You likely won't get a round of waters sitting on the back patio on a 90 degree day unless you go steal cups from the back bar and fill them yourself from the cooler next to it. 

A table of 8 that orders a round of drinks will get 5 or 6 brought out, with 2 of them completely wrong. You might see the other two 20 minutes later with the server rushing away before you can try and order food. Another favorite of mine was waiting 45 minutes for a server to even come over and then being told you can't order from the brunch menu because it is now literally 1 minute past their brunch hours. 

They were my sponsor bar for years and my team all agrees to go elsewhere, at the expense of the free beer were supposed to get there, because the experience is always so incredibly terrible.

Not sure if you’re into music or shows, but Chicago has a great live music scene and many comedy shows available—these might also be worth checking into.  Millennium Park has a free concert series on the weekend that runs all summer long, or there are many local bars hosting live music events.  

Getting on the water, lake or river, is another one of my favorite things to do in Chicago summer.  Groupon sometimes has deals for architecture tour or other boats.  Water taxis are a cheap and underrated way to travel between popular ports downtown and see a different angle of the city.

lhjb2m5,1epahhb,wjbc,"Yes, I ate at Charlie Trotter's twice. Both were celebrations with my wife. The second time we met Charlie Trotter and his mother, and they could not have been more gracious.

Both dinners were three hour events, and well worth it. As you may know, the menu was different every night. The servings were relatively small, but there were many courses and we left full and with a box of fine chocolates.

We did not indulge in the more expensive wines from the restaurant's extensive selection. If we had our bill could easily have been twice as large.

lhjg9fo,1epahhb,PlasticPanda4429,"Yes, once and it was the experience people said it was. I know life in that kitchen was rough but you didn't see it in the dining room.


We just started dating, were early/mid 20s and just getting into the food scene. The staff was so gracious from the moment we walked in until we left (with mignardise - we savored for days). It was so obvious we were complete newbs. We were new to wine and the wine list was a bible. I asked our server to suggest a bottle of wine with dinner and they chose a $28 bottle for us (Selbach Oster Reisling). They gave us the label  and Charlie signed our menu which is hanging in our kitchen. Great memories from that one experience.

lhjspsu,1epahhb,Mayor_of_Flavortown,"Just finished the doc!

lhlguos,1epahhb,nick92675,"A handful of times. My oldest brother is a huge foodie and took me there - no way I could afford it myself the first couple times.

The first time Julia child was a few tables over from us.  The whole experience was on a level so far and above what I'd ever had or any other restaurant I'd been to was.  

One favorite story is one of the times I showed up in my 86 ford tempo that had the bumper tied on with a piece of rope and got out and the valet jumps out and I give him the keys and the juxtaposition of being in a suit and in front of the world class place with service only the 'elite' would get and I watch my shitty car pull off down Armitage.  Like I knew I didn't belong there - but at the sane time I was treated like a prince while in there even though I was a broke college kid.

Which reminds me of the suit thing - it was the last era of properly dressing up to go out to dinner.  Contrast to somewhere around when blackbird opened, it started to be more accessible to be more casual at fine dining places. You could feel the change in the city as places like blackbird and avec opened.  They felt younger/hipper than trotters, played cooler music.  Trotters felt like you were playing grown up or like you were European royalty, but on armitage.

Even of his contemporaries I ate at chez panisse around then and that felt more relaxed.

While watching the doc my wife goes 'remember the time trotter got pissed at me for not eating snails?'  He came to the table and it was on one of the courses and she was allergic to them (I believe this was before restaurants commonly asked about food allergies - you just didn't eat it...) I forget exactly what he said, it was something very passive aggressive but his contempt for not eating everything on the plate was felt.

I believe this same visit I was with my friend who had worked there for a stint, but eventually quit.  He left to help open a restaurant in NY and eventually got out of the restaurant world.  Anyway- there was some definite fuck you vibes still going on towards my friend.  I believe he said some things along the line of smiling/laughingly/but still very serious undertone 'so you couldn't cut it in my kitchen and gave up like a total failure huh?'  To a table of 8 doing full wine/meal pairing.  Like you were his guests kind of and we was there because he was supposed to play nice but really he was like fuck you you are in my world- I could give a shit what you want.  Like grant was saying in the doc, you couldn't tell if he liked or hated you.  But he had an absolutely massive presence about him. You could tell you were in the presence of greatness or excellence.  And it made you want to pursue it yourself having experienced it.

First time I ever got a kitchen tour was there too, it was fascinating to see the inner workings of a fine dining restaurant.

Also first tasting menu I ever had.

All that said it was absolutely massive for food in America and Chicago.  Overall they were all stellar dining experiences that the people that shared those meals together still talk about them years later.  Like just next level that nobody else was doing.  Ironically alinea is the only place since I feel I can say the same about- and we owe that to trotter too.   It's a rare thing to make a single meal something you remember 20 years later.

EDIT - my friend just reminded me of said night and I forgot that at one point Charlie flipped off one of our party (I'm quite sure he deserved it fwiw) and then said friend asked Charlie to do it again so he could get a picture to which Charlie told him 'fuck off'

What a night.",16,2024-08-11 09:52:35
lhjdde0,1epahhb,gigglemode,Many times. My favorite was three days after 9/11. No shipments of food could be delivered so relied on all hyper local produce. A multi-course corn meal.

I'm on mobile and I don't want to flip back and forth to your list so apologies if there's any repeats. Born and raised in Bridgeport and it'll show.

Big Boss Fried Chicken - solid fried chicken sandwich spots, dare I say best on the south side. Huge portions, reasonable prices.

35th St Red Hots - you've probably seen Red Hot Ranch burgers floating around IG and whatnot, this is the OG spot. I haven't been in a long time and they didn't have burgers when I was growing up but maybe they do now?

Maxwell's on 31st - hole in the wall, serves the same stuff you'd find at Jim's for the most part. Pork chop sandwich is like flipping a coin for quality but if you get a nice one with a thick fat cap might be my favorite sandwich ever.

Kimski - Polish-Korean fusion. 3 Little Pigs is also opening up right next door so check that out too when that happens.

Min's Noodle House for Chinese noodles, unmatched in the area IMO.

Franco's for solid Italian sit-down meals. Same with Gio's.

Grand Palace for family style Chinese (largely Cantonese) fare.

Dolo is the best dimsum experience in Chinatown by a mile, the service is very hit or miss though.

I know Rico's is on the list already but I'll put another vote for it - I think it's a must have for the breaded steak and chicken vesuvio.

Chinatown spots probably get more than enough buzz so I'll skip the rest of those.

Chile Toreado has some good Mexican food and La Palapa’s outdoor setting for Mexican seafood is pretty good. Both are in McKinley Park. 

Don’t forget birria at Birreria Zaragoza in Archer Heights.

For Italian, you got Bacchanalia and Ignotz in Little Italy, Gio’s Cafe in Bridgeport, and Palermo’s on 63rd or 95th.

4. Daley’s Cafe but I haven’t been to their new location. Totally classic south side diner.
5. Antique Taco might be controversial but I love their food and the patio is amazing. Interesting specials and they’re always hosting different kinds of events. They do a lot for the neighborhood. Try to go to one of the events where they’re doing a special like birria, grilled steak tacos, etc.

l68sxfu,1d3kvqb,jtd951,"I’m about to end a month stay here in Chicago on the south side in Bronzeville just south of 35th. Have really enjoyed the area and access to CTA and loved being in this city.

Pearl’s Place, had the New Orleans breakfast that came with salmon croquette and grits. Really enjoyed it.

Truth! - Bird N Batter (chicken and waffles) was very solid, got a side of cheese hash browns and jerk turkey sausage. The leftovers hit so hard after a day/night out of 1 too many beers.

Pizza Capri (Hyde Park)- had a delicious pizza, rosemary potato and chicken with white wine sauce and a very solid frozen strawberry daiquiri before catching Furiosa last Sunday. I thought I was going to have leftovers but the thing just disappeared on me 😃

Yassa - Maffe (savory peanut butter lamb curry with veggies) with fufu or djollof rice is a great option I got fufu. The fataya (salmon empanada) was very tasty as well. I also got thiakry which was a very unique tapioca pudding like dessert.

35th St Red Hots - 4.95 for a dog and fresh cut fries is pretty hard to beat if that’s what you want. The fries were very good.

Little Sandwich House- cute spot for a coffee and a tasty little sandwich, was super convenient when walking to pick up groceries at Mariano’s. Went 3x

Greek Prime in Bridgeport on 35th is really good and great value. Their pork bowl for $14 was one of the most well seasoned and tasty and satisfying things I’ve had on this trip. Been there 2x and may go again tonight if I get hungry... The Greek potatoes are so good. Rice pudding is great. I’ve had a beer and or dessert disappear off my ticket each time.

Phil’s pizza is great. Mainly takeout only but highly recommended. I got a medium sausage and mushroom pizza that I ate on for 3 days.

I’ve been to Ricobene’s 3x, the vesuvio chicken sandwich with sweet and or hot peppers is better than the breaded steak IMO. The cutlet being submerged in garlic butter is just glorious. Add a little salt if needed and enjoy a seriously great sandwich with pretty huge bang for the $",3,2024-05-29 17:43:31

ksgmb3g,1b1r3m8,Boollish,"To riff off of your comment about chicken sandwiches and the relative price of sushi, do you feel like these places need multiple visits to get a good average?

ksgnhc0,1b1r3m8,Boollish,"Two comments specifically for Yume that stood out to me: 


>Paying extra to get uni at an omakase is a crime (this is definitely up there for one of the more pretentious and entitled sentences I've ever written publicly.) although the uni itself was amazing.  


This is a loaded statement. I cannot speak for Yume, and I've never been, but brand name uni does exist and can cost an astronomical amount, enough that I am willing to give places a pass on doing this provided they have something good, kind of like how many fine dining restaurants have caviar supplement for things. A half pound ish box of brand name, auction quality uni can run you cleably over $1000.


>When I went, all the fish was precut in a box but people I've talked to have said that they thought that was unusual and not their experience, so maybe I went on an off night. 


You will find a mix of this, and there really isn't a right or wrong way, although having pre cut means the chef can spend more time with guests and less time wiping things down. Even the top top tier sushiyas will use pre cut product, especially for preparations that are more time consuming.",4,2024-02-27 18:36:02

ksh4257,1b1r3m8,SPACasaurusRex,Went to Kyoten in 2018 early on when he opened. Super approachable and talkative. Open to any questions and I’m glad that’s still the case. Still the best Omakase experience and meal I’ve had. Must say that the price tag was like $225 or 275 at the time and I’m pretty tempted to go back now even at this price.,3,2024-02-27 20:18:16

Just curious. Is there any love for Ora in Andersonville/edgewater? I haven't been since they moved a little further North. I'm not sure if they offer omakase or not. I moved during the pandemic and they were my goto take out spot on pay day. 

Thanks for all your detailed work and deep pockets!",2,2024-02-27 23:14:29
ktag66p,1b1r3m8,Ovy_on_the_Drager,"Thanks, and great work. Having been to almost all of these as well, my personal rankings line up almost identically with yours. 

Agree that Omakase Room doesn’t get the recognition in general that it deserves, as well as your hypothesis that it may have to do with its Sushi San/LEYE affiliation. I was put off by the upcharge on identical drinks vs pricing at regular Sushi San — felt like a cash grab that just left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Kyoten I will put up there with some of the mid-to-lower-high end omakase places in Japan (typing this currently while in the air returning from a 2 week trip there). Love also that Otto Phan is a bit of a wine nerd and prefers the unconventional. Doesn’t feel like he’s offering the most totemic or upcharge-able wines but rather is going with what he truly enjoys. ",2,2024-03-04 06:50:56

Fantastic recommendation, probably the best non-nigiri courses with some truly unique and interesting options. Fish sourcing and prep also fantastic along with the sake pairings.

I may have messed up by starting out with Omakase Yume as my first experience 🤣 When I went in Jan, the fish were all pre-cut as well. I also found it odd that 3 out of the 15 courses were not all sushi/nigiri. I think they counted a hot dish and dessert and one other in the 15. Is this common at other omakase?",1,2024-04-23 16:48:33
l8gglvl,1b1r3m8,dbl_aa,At the risk of resurrecting this thread... If I was visiting Chicago and wanted to get one high-end Omakase meal in while I was there would you recommend Yume or the Omakase Room? Keeping in mind that Yume doesn't take a deposit and I can keep my plans a little more flexible as a result. We don't have any dining like this where I am from so I imagine ANY of these places would be quite the experience for me.,1,2024-06-13 12:41:39
